	abstract = {Whipworms are common soil-transmitted helminths that cause debilitating chronic infections in man. These nematodes are only distantly related to Caenorhabditis elegans and have evolved to occupy an unusual niche, tunneling through epithelial cells of the large intestine. We report here the whole-genome sequences of the human-infective Trichuris trichiura and the mouse laboratory model Trichuris muris. On the basis of whole-transcriptome analyses, we identify many genes that are expressed in a sex- or life stage–specific manner and characterize the transcriptional landscape of a morphological region with unique biological adaptations, namely, bacillary band and stichosome, found only in whipworms and related parasites. Using RNA sequencing data from whipworm-infected mice, we describe the regulated T helper 1 (TH1)-like immune response of the chronically infected cecum in unprecedented detail. In silico screening identified numerous new potential drug targets against trichuriasis. Together, these genomes and associated functional data elucidate key aspects of the molecular host-parasite interactions that define chronic whipworm infection.},

The phylogenetic association of the recognition proteins, TLR11 and TLR12, with T. gondii resistance is weak, but there is evidence for reciprocal polymorphism between parasite virulence proteins and host IRG proteins that strongly suggests current or recent coevolution.},

	abstract = {Background
Low complexity regions (LCRs) are a ubiquitous feature in genomes and yet their evolutionary history and functional roles are unclear. Previous studies have shown contrasting evidence in favor of both neutral and selective mechanisms of evolution for different sets of LCRs suggesting that modes of identification of these regions may play a role in our ability to discern their evolutionary history. To further investigate this issue, we used a multiple threshold approach to identify species-specific profiles of proteome complexity and, by comparing properties of these sets, determine the influence that starting parameters have on evolutionary inferences.

Results
We find that, although qualitatively similar, quantitatively each species has a unique LCR profile which represents the frequency of these regions within each genome. Inferences based on these profiles are more accurate in comparative analyses of genome complexity as they allow to determine the relative complexity of multiple genomes as well as the type of repetitiveness that is most common in each. Based on the multiple threshold LCR sets obtained, we identified predominant evolutionary mechanisms at different complexity levels, which show neutral mechanisms acting on highly repetitive LCRs (e.g., homopolymers) and selective forces becoming more important as heterogeneity of the LCRs increases.

Conclusions
Our results show how inferences based on LCRs are influenced by the parameters used to identify these regions. Sets of LCRs are heterogeneous aggregates of regions that include homo- and heteropolymers and, as such, evolve according to different mechanisms. LCR profiles provide a new way to investigate genome complexity across species and to determine the driving mechanism of their evolution.

Some proteins secreted by these protozoan parasites represent virulence factors and contribute to the survival of these pathogen in the human hosts. Therefore, alteration in the secretion of these proteins could result in attenuation of parasite virulence. Calreticulin is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein involved in the quality control of glycoprotein folding in higher eukaryotes. Previously, we isolated and characterized a calreticulin homologue (LdCR) from Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. To assess whether modulation of LdCR level in the parasite could affect the release of secretory proteins by Leishmania, we established L. donovani cell lines overexpressing LdCR or its putative N-, P-, or C-domains. In this report, we show that the secretion of secretory acid phosphatase and possibly other proteins trafficking through the secretory pathway of the parasite were affected as a result of overexpression of LdCR P- or C-domain. In addition, parasites expressing either the LdCR N- or P-domain showed significant decrease in survival inside macrophages in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that disruption of the functions of calreticulin in Leishmania can result in an alteration of the parasite secretory pathway and also reduce its virulence in vitro.},

In this study, we show the abundant B1 family of short interspersed DNA elements (SINEs) is a very promising source of such markers. Thirteen Bl sequences from different regions of the genome were retrieved on the basis of their high degree of homology to a mouse consensus sequence, and the presence of these elements was screened for in wild derived mice representing M. spretus, macedonicus and spicilegus and the different subspecies of M. musculus. At five of these loci, varying degrees of insertion polymorphism were found in M. m. domesticus mice. These insertions were almost totally absent in the mice representing the other subspecies and species. Six other Bl elements were fixed in all the Mus species tested. At these loci, polymorphism associated with three restriction sites in the Bl consensus sequence was found in M. musculus. Most of these polymorphisms appear to be ancestral as they are shared by at least one of the other Mus species tested. Both insertion and restriction polymorphism revealed differences between five inbred laboratory strains considered to be of mainly domesticus origin, and at the six restriction loci a surprising number of these strains carried restriction variants that were either not found or very infrequent in domesticus. This suggests that in this particular group of loci, allcles of far Eastern origin are more frequent than expected.},

	abstract = {Although asexual reproduction via clonal propagation has been proposed as the principal reproductive mechanism across parasitic protozoa of the Leishmania genus, sexual recombination has long been suspected, based on hybrid marker profiles detected in field isolates from different geographical locations. The recent experimental demonstration of a sexual cycle in Leishmania within sand flies has confirmed the occurrence of hybridisation, but knowledge of the parasite life cycle in the wild still remains limited. Here, we use whole genome sequencing to investigate the frequency of sexual reproduction in Leishmania, by sequencing the genomes of 11 Leishmania infantum isolates from sand flies and 1 patient isolate in a focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Çukurova province of southeast Turkey. This is the first genome-wide examination of a vector-isolated population of Leishmania parasites. A genome-wide pattern of patchy heterozygosity and SNP density was observed both within individual strains and across the whole group. Comparisons with other Leishmania donovani complex genome sequences suggest that these isolates are derived from a single cross of two diverse strains with subsequent recombination within the population. This interpretation is supported by a statistical model of the genomic variability for each strain compared to the L. infantum reference genome strain as well as genome-wide scans for recombination within the population. Further analysis of these heterozygous blocks indicates that the two parents were phylogenetically distinct. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium indicate that this population reproduced primarily clonally following the original hybridisation event, but that some recombination also occurred. This observation allowed us to estimate the relative rates of sexual and asexual reproduction within this population, to our knowledge the first quantitative estimate of these events during the Leishmania life cycle., Sexual reproduction is predicted to be a rare event in Leishmania parasites, as evidenced by detection of rare parasite hybrids in natural populations using molecular methods. Recently, a sexual cycle has been detected experimentally in parasites within the sand fly vector (that transmits this pathogenic microorganism to mammalian species including man, causing human leishmaniasis). In this study, we have used whole genome sequencing to investigate genetic variation at the highest level of resolution in Leishmania parasites isolated from sand flies in a defined focus of leishmaniasis in southeast Turkey. Using a range of analytical tools, we show that variation in these parasites arose following a single cross between two diverse strains and subsequent recombination between the progeny, despite mainly clonal reproduction in the parasite population. We have thus been able to derive quantitative estimates of the relative rates of sexual and asexual reproduction during the Leishmania life cycle for the first time, information that will be critical to our understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of this genus.},

These proteins play crucial roles in motility and invasion, most likely by mediating adhesion between parasite and host cell surfaces and facilitating the transmission of dynamic forces generated by the parasite actinomyosin cytoskeleton. Members of the TRAP family of microneme proteins are characterised by having extracellular domains containing one or more types of cysteine-rich, adhesive modules, highly-conserved transmembrane regions and cytosolic tails that contain one or more tyrosines, stretches of acidic residues and a single tryptophan. In this paper, we describe a novel member of the TRAP family, EtMIC4, a 218 kDa microneme protein from Eimeria tenella. EtMIC4 contains 31 epidermal growth factor (EGF) modules, 12 thrombospondin type-1 (TSP-1) modules and a highly acidic, proline and glycine-rich region in its extracellular region, plus the conserved transmembrane and cytosolic tail. Like EtMIC1, another TRAP family member from E. tenella, EtMIC4 is expressed in sporozoites and all the merozoite stages of the parasite, suggesting that this parasite has a strong requirement for TSP-1 modules. Unlike the other microneme proteins so far studied in E. tenella, EtMIC4 appears to be found constitutively on the sporozoite surface as well as within the micronemes.},

Many elements of experimental design can drastically affect the final observed community structure, notably the choice of primers for amplification prior to sequencing. Some targeted microbes can fail to amplify due to primer-targeted sequence divergence and be omitted from obtained sequences, leading to differences among primer pairs in the sequenced organisms even when targeting the same community. This potential source of taxonomic bias in HTS makes it prudent to investigate how primer choice will affect the sequenced community prior to investing in a costly community-wide sequencing effort. Here, we use Fluidigm's microfluidic Access Arrays (IFC) followed by Illumina® MiSeq Nano sequencing on a culture-derived local mock community to demonstrate how this approach allows for a low-cost combinatorial investigation of primer pairs and experimental samples (up to 48 primer pairs and 48 samples) to determine the most effective primers that maximize obtained communities whilst minimizing taxonomic biases.},

	abstract = {Background
Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is an experimentally neglected severe disease with a substantial burden on human health. Because of technical limitations, little is known about the biology of this important human pathogen. Whole genome analysis methods on patient-derived material are thus likely to have a substantial impact on our understanding of P. vivax pathogenesis and epidemiology. For example, it will allow study of the evolution and population biology of the parasite, allow parasite transmission patterns to be characterized, and may facilitate the identification of new drug resistance genes. Because parasitemias are typically low and the parasite cannot be readily cultured, on-site leukocyte depletion of blood samples is typically needed to remove human DNA that may be 1000X more abundant than parasite DNA. These features have precluded the analysis of archived blood samples and require the presence of laboratories in close proximity to the collection of field samples for optimal pre-cryopreservation sample preparation.

Results
Here we show that in-solution hybridization capture can be used to extract P. vivax DNA from human contaminating DNA in the laboratory without the need for on-site leukocyte filtration. Using a whole genome capture method, we were able to enrich P. vivax DNA from bulk genomic DNA from less than 0.5\% to a median of 55\% (range 20\%-80\%). This level of enrichment allows for efficient analysis of the samples by whole genome sequencing and does not introduce any gross biases into the data. With this method, we obtained greater than 5X coverage across 93\% of the P. vivax genome for four P. vivax strains from Iquitos, Peru, which is similar to our results using leukocyte filtration (greater than 5X coverage across 96\% ).

Conclusion
The whole genome capture technique will enable more efficient whole genome analysis of P. vivax from a larger geographic region and from valuable archived sample collections.},

combining target gene enrichment and library preparation. Pooled amplificates can be used in a single sequencing run and provide sequences for further phylogenetic analyses. Results based on an adequate set of genotyping markers demonstrate the potential of obtaining at least 2304 sequencing ready fragments within a short time frame. This substantially improves performance capacity compared to the time consuming single gene PCR and Sanger sequencing. Given suitable primer pair design and sample selection the approach allows SNP genotyping at high throughput and efficiency.
The approach constitutes a starting point for further genotyping applications of

	abstract = {Our intestinal microbiota harbors a diverse microbial community, often containing opportunistic bacteria with virulence potential. However, mutualistic host-microbial interactions prevent disease by opportunistic pathogens through poorly understood mechanisms. We show that the epithelial interleukin-22 receptor IL-22RA1 protects against lethal Citrobacter rodentium infection and chemical-induced colitis by promoting colonization resistance against an intestinal opportunistic bacterium, Enterococcus faecalis. Susceptibility of Il22ra1−/− mice to C. rodentium was associated with preferential expansion and epithelial translocation of pathogenic E. faecalis during severe microbial dysbiosis and was ameloriated with antibiotics active against E. faecalis. RNA sequencing analyses of primary colonic organoids showed that IL-22RA1 signaling promotes intestinal fucosylation via induction of the fucosyltransferase Fut2. Additionally, administration of fucosylated oligosaccharides to C. rodentium-challenged Il22ra1−/− mice attenuated infection and promoted E. faecalis colonization resistance by restoring the diversity of anaerobic commensal symbionts. These results support a model whereby IL-22RA1 enhances host-microbiota mutualism to limit detrimental overcolonization by opportunistic pathogens.,

A secondary hybrid zone occurs where their ranges meet, running from Scandinavia to the Black Sea. In this paper, we tested a hypothesis that the apicomplexan protozoan species Cryptosporidium tyzzeri has coevolved with the house mouse. More specifically, we assessed to what extent the evolution of this parasite mirrors divergence of the two subspecies. In order to test this hypothesis, we analysed sequence variation at five genes (ssrRNA, Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP), thrombospondin-related adhesive protein of Cryptosporidium 1 (TRAP-C1), actin and gp60) in C. tyzzeri isolates from Mmd and Mmm sampled along a transect across the hybrid zone from the Czech Republic to Germany. Mmd samples were supplemented with mice from New Zealand. We found two distinct isolates of C. tyzzeri, each occurring exclusively in one of the mouse subspecies (C. tyzzeri-Mmm and C. tyzzeri-Mmd). In addition to genetic differentiation, oocysts of the C. tyzzeri-Mmd subtype (mean: 4.24 × 3.69 μm) were significantly smaller than oocysts of C. tyzzeri-Mmm (mean: 4.49 × 3.90 μm). Mmm and Mmd were susceptible to experimental infection with both C. tyzzeri subtypes; however, the subtypes were not infective for the rodent species Meriones unguiculatus, Mastomys coucha, Apodemus flavicollis or Cavia porcellus. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that C. tyzzeri is coevolving with Mmm and Mmd.},

Genomic cline analysis has been used to evaluate alternative patterns of introgression, but only two models have been used widely and the approach has generally lacked a hypothesis testing framework for distinguishing effects of selection and drift. I propose two alternative cline models, implement multivariate outlier detection to identify markers associated with hybrid fitness, and simulate hybrid zone dynamics to evaluate the signatures of different modes of selection. Analysis of simulated data shows that previous approaches are prone to false positives (multinomial regression) or relatively insensitive to outlier loci affected by selection (Barton's concordance). The new, theory-based logit-logistic cline model is generally best at detecting loci affecting hybrid fitness. Although some generalizations can be made about different modes of selection, there is no one-to-one correspondence between pattern and process. These new methods will enhance our ability to extract important information about the genetics of reproductive isolation and hybrid fitness. However, much remains to be done to relate statistical patterns to particular evolutionary processes.

	abstract = {Background
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Cryptosporidium spp. has previously relied on propagation of the parasite in animals to generate enough oocysts from which to extract DNA of sufficient quantity and purity for analysis. We have developed and validated a method for preparation of genomic Cryptosporidium DNA suitable for WGS directly from human stool samples and used it to generate 10 high-quality whole Cryptosporidium genome assemblies. Our method uses a combination of salt flotation, immunomagnetic separation (IMS), and surface sterilisation of oocysts prior to DNA extraction, with subsequent use of the transposome-based Nextera XT kit to generate libraries for sequencing on Illumina platforms. IMS was found to be superior to caesium chloride density centrifugation for purification of oocysts from small volume stool samples and for reducing levels of contaminant DNA.

Results
The IMS-based method was used initially to sequence whole genomes of Cryptosporidium hominis gp60 subtype IbA10G2 and Cryptosporidium parvum gp60 subtype IIaA19G1R2 from small amounts of stool left over from diagnostic testing of clinical cases of cryptosporidiosis. The C. parvum isolate was sequenced to a mean depth of 51.8X with reads covering 100 \% of the bases of the C. parvum Iowa II reference genome (Bioproject PRJNA 15586), while the C. hominis isolate was sequenced to a mean depth of 34.7X with reads covering 98 \% of the bases of the C. hominis TU502 v1 reference genome (Bioproject PRJNA 15585)., The method was then applied to a further 17 stools, successfully generating another eight new whole genome sequences, of which two were C. hominis (gp60 subtypes IbA10G2 and IaA14R3) and six C. parvum (gp60 subtypes IIaA15G2R1 from three samples, and one each of IIaA17G1R1, IIaA18G2R1, and IIdA22G1), demonstrating the utility of this method to sequence Cryptosporidium genomes directly from clinical samples. This development is especially important as it reduces the requirement to propagate Cryptosporidium oocysts in animal models prior to genome sequencing.

Conclusion
This represents the first report of high-quality whole genome sequencing of Cryptosporidium isolates prepared directly from human stool samples.},

	abstract = {The phylum Apicomplexa includes serious pathogens of humans and animals. Understanding the distribution and population structure of these protozoan parasites is of fundamental importance to explain disease epidemiology and develop sustainable controls. Predicting the likely efficacy and longevity of subunit vaccines in field populations relies on knowledge of relevant preexisting antigenic diversity, population structure, the likelihood of coinfection by genetically distinct strains, and the efficiency of cross-fertilization. All four of these factors have been investigated for Plasmodium species parasites, revealing both clonal and panmictic population structures with exceptional polymorphism associated with immunoprotective antigens such as apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). For the coccidian Toxoplasma gondii only genomic diversity and population structure have been defined in depth so far; for the closely related Eimeria species, all four variables are currently unknown. Using Eimeria tenella, a major cause of the enteric disease coccidiosis, which exerts a profound effect on chicken productivity and welfare, we determined population structure, genotype distribution, and likelihood of cross-fertilization during coinfection and also investigated the extent of naturally occurring antigenic diversity for the E. tenella AMA1 homolog. Using genome-wide Sequenom SNP-based haplotyping, targeted sequencing, and single-cell genotyping, we show that in this coccidian the functionality of EtAMA1 appears to outweigh immune evasion. This result is in direct contrast to the situation in Plasmodium and most likely is underpinned by the biology of the direct and acute coccidian life cycle in the definitive host.},

This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster.

	abstract = {Growth arrest-specific (Gas) genes are expressed during serum starvation or contact inhibition of cells grown in culture. Here we report the isolation and characterization of Gas8, a novel gene identified on the basis of its growth arrest-specific expression in murine fibroblasts. We show that production of Gas8mRNA and protein occurs in adult mice predominantly in the testes, where expression is regulated during postmeiotic development of male gametocytes. Whereas a low level of Gas8 mRNA was detected by Northern blotting in testes of murine male neonates and young adolescents, Gas8 mRNA increased rapidly postmeiotically. In adult males, both Gas8 mRNA and protein reached steady state levels in testes that were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that Gas8 protein accumulates in gametocytes as they approach the lumen of seminiferous tubules and is localized to the cytoplasm of round spermatids, the tails of elongating spermatids, and mature spermatid tail bundles protruding into the lumen; in epididymal spermatozoa Gas8 protein was present in the flagella. However, premeiotic murine gametocytes lacked detectable Gas8 protein, as did seminiferous tubules in biopsy specimens from seven human males having cytological evidence of non-obstructive azoospermia secondary to Sertoli cell-only syndrome. Our findings, which associate Gas8 production developmentally with the later stages of spermatogenesis and spatially with the sperm motility apparatus, collectively suggest that this growth arrest-specific gene product may have a role in sperm motility. This postulated role for Gas8 is supported by our observation that highly localized production of Gas8 protein occurs also in the cilia of epithelial cells lining pulmonary bronchi and fallopian tubes and by the flagellar association of a Trypanosoma brucei ortholog of Gas8.},

Here, we reported that a protein, named Ss-Sl2, is involved in sclerotial development of  Sclerotinia sclerotiorum . Ss-Sl2 does not show significant homology with any protein of known function. Ss-Sl2 contains two putative PAN modules which were found in other proteins with diverse adhesion functions. Ss-Sl2 is a secreted protein, during the initial stage of sclerotial development, copious amounts of Ss-Sl2 are secreted and accumulated on the cell walls. The ability to maintain the cellular integrity of RNAi-mediated  Ss-Sl2  silenced strains was reduced, but the hyphal growth and virulence of  Ss-Sl2  silenced strains were not significantly different from the wild strain.  Ss-Sl2  silenced strains could form interwoven hyphal masses at the initial stage of sclerotial development, but the interwoven hyphae could not consolidate and melanize. Hyphae in these interwoven bodies were thin-walled, and arranged loosely. Co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Woronin body major protein (Hex1) and elongation factor 1-alpha interact with Ss-Sl2. GAPDH-knockdown strains showed a similar phenotype in sclerotial development as  Ss-Sl2  silenced strains. Hex1-knockdown strains showed similar impairment in maintenance of hyphal integrity as  Ss-Sl2  silenced strains.

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii has evolved a number of strategies to evade immune responses in its many hosts. Previous genetic mapping of crosses between clonal type 1, 2, and 3 strains of T. gondii, which are prevalent in Europe and North America, identified two rhoptry proteins, ROP5 and ROP18, that function together to block innate immune mechanisms activated by interferon gamma (IFNg) in murine hosts. However, the contribution of these and other virulence factors in more genetically divergent South American strains is unknown. Here we utilized a cross between the intermediately virulent North American type 2 ME49 strain and the highly virulent South American type 10 VAND strain to map the genetic basis for differences in virulence in the mouse. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of this new cross identified one peak that spanned the ROP5 locus on chromosome XII. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of all copies of ROP5 in the VAND strain rendered it avirulent and complementation confirmed that ROP5 is the major virulence factor accounting for differences between type 2 and type 10 strains. To extend these observations to other virulent South American strains representing distinct genetic populations, we knocked out ROP5 in type 8 TgCtBr5 and type 4 TgCtBr18 strains, resulting in complete loss of virulence in both backgrounds. Consistent with this, polymorphisms that show strong signatures of positive selection in ROP5 were shown to correspond to regions known to interface with host immunity factors. Because ROP5 and ROP18 function together to resist innate immune mechanisms, and a significant interaction between them was identified in a two-locus scan, we also assessed the role of ROP18 in the virulence of South American strains. Deletion of ROP18 in South American type 4, 8, and 10 strains resulted in complete attenuation in contrast to a partial loss of virulence seen for ROP18 knockouts in previously described type 1 parasites. These data show that ROP5 and ROP18 are conserved virulence factors in genetically diverse strains from North and South America, suggesting they evolved to resist innate immune defenses in ancestral T. gondii strains, and they have subsequently diversified under positive selection., Parasites and the hosts they infect are in constant struggle with each other for survival. On the one hand, the host needs to control parasite growth, while the parasite needs to evade the host response long enough to allow for efficient transmission. The parasite Toxoplasma gondii has evolved virulence factors ROP5 and ROP18 to evade innate immune mechanisms of its natural intermediate host, small rodents. These genes were initially identified in clonal parasite types isolated from Europe and North America, but the factors that contribute to virulence in genetically divergent South American strains have not been tested. Here we used forward and reverse genetic analyses to show that ROP5 and ROP18 are also major virulence factors in genetically distinct virulent South American strains. Given that ROP5 and ROP18 function as virulence factors in strains from North America, Europe, and South America they likely acquired their functions before Toxoplasma gondii radiated into its present global population structure.},

	abstract = {Although gastrointestinal colonization by the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is generally benign, severe systemic infections are thought to arise due to escape of commensal C. albicans from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The C. albicans transcription factor Efg1p is a major regulator of GI colonization, hyphal morphogenesis, and virulence. The goals of this study were to identify the Efg1p regulon during GI tract colonization and to compare C. albicans gene expression during colonization of different organs of the GI tract. Our results identified significant differences in gene expression between cells colonizing the cecum and ileum. During colonization, efg1− null mutant cells expressed higher levels of genes involved in lipid catabolism, carnitine biosynthesis, and carnitine utilization than did colonizing wild-type (WT) cells. In addition, during laboratory growth, efg1− null mutant cells grew to a higher density than WT cells. The efg1− null mutant grew in depleted medium, while WT cells could grow only if the depleted medium was supplemented with carnitine, a compound that promotes the metabolism of fatty acids. Altered gene expression and altered growth capability support the ability of efg1− cells to hypercolonize naïve mice. Also, Efg1p was shown to be important for transcriptional responses to the stresses present in the cecum environment. For example, during colonization, SOD5, encoding a superoxide dismutase, was highly upregulated in an Efg1p-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of SOD5 in an efg1− null mutant increased the fitness of the efg1− null mutant cells during colonization. These data show that EFG1 is an important regulator of GI colonization.},

The close relationship between P. reichenowi and P. falciparum is emphasized by almost complete conservation of genomic synteny, but against this strikingly conserved background we observe major differences at loci involved in erythrocyte invasion. The organization of most virulence-associated multigene families, including the hypervariable var genes, is broadly conserved, but P. falciparum has a smaller subset of rif and stevor genes whose products are expressed on the infected erythrocyte surface. Genome-wide analysis identifies other loci under recent positive selection, but a limited number of changes at the host–parasite interface may have mediated host switching.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is caused by a one-celled protozoan parasite known as Toxoplasma gondii. In the United States, it is estimated that approximately 30\% of cats, the primary carriers, have been infected by T. gondii. Most humans contract toxoplasmosis by eating cyst-contaminated raw or undercooked meat, vegetables, or milk products or when they come into contact with the T. gondii eggs from cat feaces while cleaning a cat's litterbox, gardening, or playing in a sandbox. Approx 1 in 4 (more than 60 million) people in the USA are infected with the parasite, and in the UK between 0.5 and 1\% of individuals become infected each year. By the age of 50, 40\% of people test positive for the parasite. The predilection of this parasite is for the central nervous system (CNS) causing behavioral and personality alterations as well as fatal necrotizing encephalitis, and is especially dangerous for HIV infected patients.Though there have been tremendous strides in our understanding of the biology of Toxoplasma gondii in the last decade, there has been no systemic review of all of the information that has accumulated. Toxoplasma gondii provides the first comprehensive summary of literature on this organism by leading experts in the field who were responsible for organising the 7th International Congress on Toxoplasmosis in May 2003. It offeres systematic reviews of the biology of this pathogen as well as descriptions of the methods and resources used. Within the next year the T. gondii genome will be completed making this an indispensable research resource for biologists, physicians, parasitologists, and for all those contemplating experiments using T. gondii.* Serves as a model for understanding invasion of host cells by parasites, immune response, motility, differentiation, phylogenetics, evolution and organelle acquisition* Discusses the protocols related to genetic manipulation, cell biology and animal models while also providing reference material on available resources for working with this organism},

Recent coevolutionary theory has indicated that the geographic structure of species has the potential to impose powerful and continuing effects on coevolutionary dynamics, if that structure creates selection mosaics and coevolutionary hotspots across landscapes. Here we confirm that current coevolutionary selection in interspecific interactions can be highly divergent across both narrow and broad geographic scales, thereby fuelling continuing coevolution of taxa. Study of a widespread plant–insect interaction across a broad range of habitats for several years showed that an insect functioning both as a pollinator and a floral parasite can be strongly mutualistic in some habitats but commensal or antagonistic in neighbouring habitats. The results for one of the habitats span seven years, demonstrating that the local structure of coevolutionary selection can remain stable across multiple generations. Conservation of the evolutionary processes maintaining long-term biological diversity may require preservation of the conditions that allow a long-term shifting geographic mosaic of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots.},

Correlated gene expression profiles can be used to identify molecular interactions within a species.

We go on to examine our predictions of molecular interactions between the malaria parasite and both its mammalian host and insect vector. Our approach could be applied to study any interaction between species, for example, between a host and its parasites or pathogens, but also symbiotic and commensal pairings.},

	abstract = {Chicken coccidiosis is caused by Eimeria spp., particularly Eimeria tenella, and is characterized by watery or hemorrhagic diarrhea, resulting in death in severe cases. Precociously attenuated live vaccines are widely used to control the disease, and these are produced by serially passaging virulent strains through chickens, and the collection of oocysts from feces at progressively earlier time points during oocyst shedding. Sporozoites of the precocious strain rapidly enter the intestinal mucosa, and their subsequent asexual development reduces their growth. However, there have been few detailed genetic or transcriptional analyses of the strains. Here, we used RNA sequencing to gain novel biological insight into the pathogenicity and precocity of E. tenella. We compared the differential transcription in the sporozoites (the initial stage of endogenous development) of virulent and precocious strains by mapping the sequence reads onto the draft genome of E. tenella. About 90\% of the reads from both strains were mapped to the genome, and 16,630 estimated transcript regions were identified. Using Gene Ontology slim and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses and the annotation of the estimated transcripts with Blastx, we found that the expression of some genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were expressed two-fold more strongly in the virulent strain than in the precocious strain. Characteristically, genes related to proteins secreted from the apical complex, proteases, cell attachment proteins, mitochondrial proteins, and transporters were most strongly upregulated in the virulent strain. Interestingly, the expression of genes associated with cell survival, development, or proliferation was strongly upregulated in the precocious strain. These findings suggest that virulent strains survive long before invasion and invade actively/successfully into host cells, whereas proliferative processes appear to affect precocity.},

	abstract = {Host-parasite interaction studies across hybrid zones often focus on host genetic variation, treating parasites as homogeneous. ‘Intimately’ associated hosts and parasites might be expected to show similar patterns of genetic structure. In the literature, factors such as no intermediate host and no free-living stage have been proposed as ‘intimacy’ factors likely constraining parasites to closely follow the evolutionary history of their hosts. To test whether the whipworm, Trichuris muris, is intimately associated with its house mouse host, we studied its population genetics across the European house mouse hybrid zone (HMHZ) which has a strong central barrier to gene flow between mouse taxa. T. muris has a direct life cycle and nonmobile free stage: if these traits constrain the parasite to an intimate association with its host we expect a geographic break in the parasite genetic structure across the HMHZ. We genotyped 205 worms from 56 localities across the HMHZ and additionally T. muris collected from sympatric woodmice (Apodemus spp.) and allopatric murine species, using mt-COX1, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA and 10 microsatellites. We show four haplogroups of mt-COX1 and three clear ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 clades in the HMHZ suggesting a complex demographic/phylogeographic history. Microsatellites show strong structure between groups of localities. However, no marker type shows a break across the HMHZ. Whipworms from Apodemus in the HMHZ cluster, and share mitochondrial haplotypes, with those from house mice. We conclude Trichuris should not be regarded as an ‘intimate’ parasite of the house mouse: while its life history might suggest intimacy, passage through alternate hosts is sufficiently common to erase signal of genetic structure associated with any particular host taxon.},

Further genetic and immunological analyses reveal genetic incompatibilities, aberrant immune gene expression and increased intestinal pathology associated with altered community structure among hybrids.

However, direct observations of hybrid zone movement are difficult to make unless the zone is moving rapidly.

Local populations of mice across two transects in Germany and the Czech Republic were sampled, and a total of 1301 mice were genotyped at 1401 markers from the nuclear genome. Empirical measures of LD provide evidence for extinction and (re)colonization in single populations and, together with simulations, suggest hybrid zone movement because of either geography-dependent asymmetrical dispersal or selection favouring one subspecies over the other.},

In doing so, we contrast laboratory models of genetic exchange in parasitic protozoa with natural patterns of genetic diversity and consider the fitness advantage of sex at different evolutionary scales. We discuss approaches to improve the accuracy of efforts to characterize genetic exchange in the field. We also examine the implications of the first population genomic studies for the debate around sex and clonality in parasitic protozoa and discuss caveats for the future.},

	abstract = {A central point not yet elucidated in immuno-ecological studies is whether the different ways to assess the immune status of individuals are good indicators of parasite resistance of the host. We investigate the relationship between immunocompetence and the resistance/susceptibility phenotype of five strains of two European subspecies of the house mouse and their hybrids derived from natural populations. The assessment of immunocompetence was measured indirectly by the mass of the spleen and directly by the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) test. The resistance of each mouse strain to common helminths was previously determined by the distribution of parasite burdens obtained after experimental infection. We found no relationship between the resistance/susceptibility phenotype of strains and the level of PHA response or the size of the spleen. A significant negative correlation was found between residuals of log spleen mass (controlled for body mass) and PHA response, suggesting that these two components of immune function are not independent measures of defence against parasitism. We discuss the validity of these two techniques of measuring immunocompetence and emphasize the importance of taking into account the complexity of the immune system at structural and functional levels in understanding the component of selection attributable to parasitism in the evolution of immunocompetence.},

	abstract = {Genome sequence analysis reveals that the zoonotic malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi consists of three highly divergent subpopulations. Two, commonly seen in sympatric human clinical infections in Malaysian Borneo, were identified in a previous study as corresponding to parasites seen in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaque hosts, respectively. A third type has been detected in a few laboratory-maintained isolates originally derived in the 1960s elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Divergence between the subpopulations varies significantly across the genome but overall is at a level indicating different subspecies. Analysis of the diversity within the most common type in human infections shows strong signatures of natural selection, including balancing selection and directional selection, on loci distinct from those under selection in endemic human malaria parasites., Malaria cases caused by the zoonotic parasite Plasmodium knowlesi are being increasingly reported throughout Southeast Asia and in travelers returning from the region. To test for evidence of signatures of selection or unusual population structure in this parasite, we surveyed genome sequence diversity in 48 clinical isolates recently sampled from Malaysian Borneo and in five lines maintained in laboratory rhesus macaques after isolation in the 1960s from Peninsular Malaysia and the Philippines. Overall genomewide nucleotide diversity (π = 6.03 × 10−3) was much higher than has been seen in worldwide samples of either of the major endemic malaria parasite species Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. A remarkable substructure is revealed within P. knowlesi, consisting of two major sympatric clusters of the clinical isolates and a third cluster comprising the laboratory isolates. There was deep differentiation between the two clusters of clinical isolates [mean genomewide fixation index (FST) = 0.21, with 9,293 SNPs having fixed differences of FST = 1.0]. This differentiation showed marked heterogeneity across the genome, with mean FST values of different chromosomes ranging from 0.08 to 0.34 and with further significant variation across regions within several chromosomes. Analysis of the largest cluster (cluster 1, 38 isolates) indicated long-term population growth, with negatively skewed allele frequency distributions (genomewide average Tajima’s D = −1.35). Against this background there was evidence of balancing selection on particular genes, including the circumsporozoite protein (csp) gene, which had the top Tajima’s D value (1.57), and scans of haplotype homozygosity implicate several genomic regions as being under recent positive selection.},

However, the use of spleen size in mammals is more complicated because, in addition to having an immune function, the mammalian spleen is also a reservoir for red blood cells.
* 2To assess the reliability of mammalian spleen mass as an indicator of immune activity, we quantified the white and red pulp mass by histology of spleens from shot red deer Cervus elaphus. We then analysed the relationships among spleen mass, the amounts of white and red pulp, and the deer's body condition relative to faecal counts of the nematode parasite Elaphostrongylus cervi.
* 3White and red pulp mass were positively correlated so that an increase in spleen mass was a positive function of both components of the spleen. In male deer, which had significantly lower body condition and higher parasite loads than females, parasite counts were negatively correlated with spleen mass, white pulp mass, and red pulp mass.
* 4Our findings suggest that (i) spleen mass in shot red deer is a reliable measure of white and red pulp content; and (ii) when looking at the red deer life history, which is greatly influenced by sex of the deer, splenic mass and white pulp mass could be used as reflections of immune system strength.
* 5Future studies of mammalian spleens can contribute to the understanding of evolved strategies of immune response investment in mammals. However, determination of the white and red pulp spleen components using various sampling methods must be made prior to their application.},

	abstract = {Abstract A complete understanding of the speciation process requires the identification of genomic regions and genes that confer reproductive barriers between species. Empirical and theoretical research has revealed two important patterns in the evolution of reproductive isolation in animals: isolation typically arises as a result of disrupted epistatic interactions between multiple loci and these disruptions map disproportionately to the X chromosome. These patterns suggest that a targeted examination of natural gene flow between closely related species at X-linked markers with known positions would provide insight into the genetic basis of speciation. We take advantage of the existence of genomic data and a well-documented European zone of hybridization between two species of house mice, Mus domesticus and M. musculus, to conduct such a survey. We evaluate patterns of introgression across the hybrid zone for 13 diagnostic X-linked loci with known chromosomal positions using a maximum likelihood model. Interlocus comparisons clearly identify one locus with reduced introgression across the center of the hybrid zone, pinpointing a candidate region for reproductive isolation. Results also reveal one locus with high frequencies of M. domesticus alleles in populations on the M. musculus side of the zone, suggesting the possibility that positive selection may act to drive the spread of alleles from one species on to the genomic background of the other species. Finally, cline width and cline center are strongly positively correlated across the X chromosome, indicating that gene flow of the X chromosome may be asymmetrical. This study highlights the utility of natural populations of hybrids for mapping speciation genes and suggests that the middle of the X chromosome may be important for reproductive isolation between species of house mice.},

These domains, which exist in a wide variety of complement and adhesion proteins, have previously been shown to be involved in protein–protein and protein–ligand interactions. Orthologous genes have also been identified in the genomes of several other Plasmodium species, suggesting a conserved function for this protein in Plasmodium. Our results show that this protein is located in apical organelles and we have therefore designated the protein apical Sushi protein (ASP). We show that the expression of ASP is tightly regulated in the intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite and that it undergoes post-translational proteolytic processing. Based on our observations of timing of expression, location and proteolytic processing, we propose a role for ASP in erythrocyte invasion.},

	abstract = {Background
The phylum Apicomplexa comprises important unicellular human parasites such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium. Eimeria is the largest and most diverse genus of apicomplexan parasites and some species of the genus are the causative agent of coccidiosis, a disease economically devastating in poultry. We report a complete genome sequence of the mouse parasite Eimeria falciformis. We assembled and annotated the genome sequence to study host-parasite interactions in this understudied genus in a model organism host.

Results
The genome of E. falciformis is 44 Mb in size and contains 5,879 predicted protein coding genes. Comparative analysis of E. falciformis with Toxoplasma gondii shows an emergence and diversification of gene families associated with motility and invasion mainly at the level of the Coccidia. Many rhoptry kinases, among them important virulence factors in T. gondii, are absent from the E. falciformis genome. Surface antigens are divergent between Eimeria species. Comparisons with T. gondii showed differences between genes involved in metabolism, N-glycan and GPI-anchor synthesis. E. falciformis possesses a reduced set of transmembrane transporters and we suggest an altered mode of iron uptake in the genus Eimeria.

Conclusions
Reduced diversity of genes required for host-parasite interaction and transmembrane transport allow hypotheses on host adaptation and specialization of a single host parasite. The E. falciformis genome sequence sheds light on the evolution of the Coccidia and helps to identify determinants of host-parasite interaction critical for drug and vaccine development.

Population genomics, the emerging approach of analyzing the complete genomes of a multitude of closely related organisms, is poised to overcome these limitations by providing a window into patterns of genome variation revealing the evolutionary processes through which species diverge. This new approach is more than just an extension of previous multilocus sequencing technologies, in that it provides a comprehensive view of interacting evolutionary processes. Here we argue that the application of population genomic tools in a rigorous population genetic framework will help to identify the processes of microbial speciation and ultimately lead to a general species concept based on the unique biology and ecology of microorganisms.},

Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods.

Coccidiosis is an intestinal infection caused by intracellular protozoan parasites belonging to several different species of Eimeria. Infection with coccidia parasites seriously impairs the growth and feed utilization of chickens and costs the US poultry industry more than \$1.5 billion in annual losses. Although acquired immunity to Eimeria develops following natural infection, due to the complex life cycle and intricate host immune response to Eimeria, vaccine development has been difficult and a better understanding of the basic immunobiology of pertinent host–parasite interactions is necessary for developing effective immunological control strategies against coccidiosis. Chickens infected with Eimeria produce parasite specific antibodies in both the circulation and mucosal secretions but humoral immunity plays only a minor role in protection against this disease. Rather, recent evidence implicates cell-mediated immunity as the major factor conferring resistance to coccidiosis. This review will summarize current understanding of the avian intestinal immune system and its response to Eimeria as well as provide a conceptual overview of the complex molecular and cellular events involved in intestinal immunity to coccidiosis. It is anticipated that increased knowledge of the interaction between parasites and host immunity will stimulate the birth of novel immunological and molecular biological concepts in the control of intestinal parasitism.},

The large amount of DNA sequence data generated by high-throughput sequencing technologies often allows multiple samples to be sequenced in parallel on a single sequencing run. This is particularly true if subsets of the genome are studied rather than complete genomes. In recent years, target capture from sequencing libraries has largely replaced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the preferred method of target enrichment. Parallelizing target capture and sequencing for multiple samples requires the incorporation of sample-specific barcodes into sequencing libraries, which is necessary to trace back the sample source of each sequence. This protocol describes a fast and reliable method for the preparation of barcoded (“indexed”) sequencing libraries for Illumina’s Genome Analyzer platform. The protocol avoids expensive commercial library preparation kits and can be performed in a 96-well plate setup using multi-channel pipettes, requiring not more than two or three days of lab work. Libraries can be prepared from any type of double-stranded DNA, even if present in subnanogram quantity.},

	abstract = {In many systems, host–parasite evolutionary dynamics have led to the emergence and maintenance of diverse parasite and host genotypes within the same population. Genotypes vary in key attributes: Parasite genotypes vary in ability to infect, host genotypes vary in susceptibility, and infection outcome is frequently the result of both parties’ genotypic identities. These host–parasite genotype-by-genotype (GH × GP) interactions influence evolutionary and ecological dynamics in important ways. Interactions can be produced through genetic variation; however, here, we assess the role of variable gene expression as an additional source of GH × GP interactions. The bumblebee Bombus terrestris and its trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi are a model system for host–parasite matching. Full-transcriptome sequencing of the bumblebee host revealed that different parasite genotypes indeed induce fundamentally different host expression responses and host genotypes vary in their responses to the infecting parasite genotype. It appears that broadly and successfully infecting parasite genotypes lead to reduced host immune gene expression relative to unexposed bees but induce the expression of genes responsible for controlling gene expression. Contrastingly, a poorly infecting parasite genotype induced the expression of immunologically important genes, including antimicrobial peptides. A targeted expression assay confirmed the transcriptome results and also revealed strong host genotype effects. In all, the expression of a number of genes depends on the host genotype and the parasite genotype and the interaction between both host and parasite genotypes. These results suggest that alongside sequence variation in coding immunological genes, variation that controls immune gene expression can also produce patterns of host–parasite specificity.},

The patterns of gene flow have been established, finding Iquitos city as a reservoir of parasite genetic variability. Moreover, a recent reduction of the parasite population was observed in areas where recent control activities were performed.

This concept has not only provided a compelling synthesis between evolutionary biology and community ecology, but has also inspired research that extends beyond its original scope. In this article, we identify unresolved questions about the co-evolutionary process and advocate for the integration of co-evolutionary research from molecular to interspecific interactions. We address two basic questions: (i) What is co-evolution and how common is it? (ii) What is the unit of co-evolution? Both questions aim to explore the heart of the co-evolutionary process. Despite the claim that co-evolution is ubiquitous, we argue that there is in fact little evidence to support the view that reciprocal natural selection and coadaptation are common in nature. We also challenge the traditional view that co-evolution only occurs between traits of interacting species. Co-evolution has the potential to explain evolutionary processes and patterns that result from intra- and intermolecular biochemical interactions within cells, intergenomic interactions (e.g. nuclear-cytoplasmic) within species, as well as intergenomic interactions mediated by phenotypic traits between species. Research that bridges across these levels of organization will help to advance our understanding of the importance of the co-evolutionary processes in shaping the diversity of life on Earth.},

This wide range may reflect differences in the efficacy of selection due to differences in the effective population size (Ne). However, most comparisons have been made among distantly related organisms that differ not only in Ne but also in many other aspects of their biology. Here, we estimate α in three closely related lineages of house mice that have a similar ecology but differ widely in Ne: Mus musculus musculus (Ne ∼ 25,000–120,000), M. m. domesticus (Ne ∼ 58,000–200,000), and M. m. castaneus (Ne ∼ 200,000–733,000). Mice were genotyped using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array, and the proportions of replacement and silent mutations within subspecies were compared with those fixed between each subspecies and an outgroup, Mus spretus. There was significant evidence of positive selection in M. m. castaneus, the lineage with the largest Ne, with α estimated to be approximately 40\%. In contrast, estimates of α for M. m. domesticus (α = 13\%) and for M. m. musculus (α = 12 \%) were much smaller. Interestingly, the higher estimate of α for M. m. castaneus appears to reflect not only more adaptive fixations but also more effective purifying selection. These results support the hypothesis that differences in Ne contribute to differences among species in the efficacy of selection.},

	title = {Phylogenetic analysis of {Eimeria} spp. parasitising house mouse subspecies based on selected genetic markers},
	abstract = {Hybrid zones are popular objects for studying genetic framework of speciation as they form natural laboratories in which recombination between distinct strains occurs. Recent studies greatly enhanced understanding of gene flow and genetic constitution across a hybrid zone of two closely related subspecies Mus musculus musculus in Eastern Europe and Mus musculus domesticus found in Western Europe. Here, a novel approach is pursued by focussing on mechanisms of parasitic speciation in hybrid zones, where parasites are exposed to both original parental and a new reservoir of recombinant host genomes. This work attempts to examine interaction of the coccidian parasite Eimeria spp. and their house mouse subspecies hosts for the first time. Using PCR-based assays of selected nuclear (18S rDNA) and extrachromosomal regions (mitochondrial COI and apicoplast tRNA region), serving as molecular markers, combined with sophisticated phylogenetic
approaches, two major Eimeria lineages were identified. While E.ex.Mmd is almost exclusively harbored in M.m.domesticus, E.ex.Mmm shows a broader host specificity parasitising M.m.musculus and hybrids as well as M.m.domesticus, the latter with lower prevalence. Although single-gene Eimeria isolates cluster in separate monophyletic groups,
multilocus phylogeographic indicates that these strains are not locally restricted and
co-exist in a single sampled locality. Besides these general patterns detected for isolates
based on single-gene trees, clade composition between the investigated markers exhibits
dissimilarities. This finding and the fact that tree topologies slightly differ indicates genes
introgressing between the western (E.ex.Mmd) and eastern (E.ex.Mmm) strain. This work is anticipated to give first glimpse into diversity and genetic structure of the dominant Eimeria spp. infecting particular subspecies hosts and their spatial distribution across the house mouse hybrid zone. In order to validate and differentiate observed patterns, further field studies with greater sampling sizes are required. In order to generate larger data sets of genetic markers from the three genomes, future analysis will also include the use of high-throughput PCR techniques.},

We propose that variation in immune defences might help explain why only some introduced populations become invasive. Introduced species escape many of their native diseases, but also face novel pathogens that can induce costly, and sometimes deadly, immune responses in naïve hosts. Therefore, favouring less resource-demanding and dangerous defence mechanisms and allocating a greater proportion of resources to growth and reproduction should favour invasion. Specifically, we argue that successful invaders should reduce costly systemic inflammatory responses, which are associated with fever and metabolic and behavioural changes, and rely more heavily on less expensive antibody-mediated immunity. Here we provide supporting arguments for this hypothesis and generate predictions that are testable using tools from the growing field of ecological immunology.},

This situation is largely due to the inadequate sample of eimerian molecular data available for reliable phylogenetic analyses. In this study, we extend the data set by adding 71 new sequences of coccidia infecting 16 small-mammal genera, mostly rodents. According to the respective feasibility of PCR gene amplification, the new samples are represented by one or more of the following genes: nuclear 18S rRNA, plastid ORF 470, and mitochondrial COI. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences confirm the previous hypothesis that Eimeria, in its current morphology-based delimitation, is not a monophyletic group. Several samples of coccidia corresponding morphologically to other genera are scattered among the Eimeria lineages. More importantly, the distribution of eimerians from different hosts indicates that the clustering of eimerian species is influenced by their host specificity, but does not arise from a cophylogenetic/cospeciation process; while several clusters are specific to a particular host group, inner topologies within these clusters do not reflect host phylogeny. This observation suggests that the host specificity of Eimeria is caused by adaptive rather than cophylogenetic processes.},

	abstract = {Multilocus hybrid zone (HZ) studies predate genomics by decades. The power of early methods is becoming apparent and now large datasets are commonplace. Relating introgression along a chromosome to evolutionary process is challenging: although reduced introgression regions may indicate speciation genes, this pattern may be obscured by asymmetric introgression of linked invasive genes. Further, HZ movement may form salients and leave islands in its wake. Barton's concordance was proposed 24 years ago for assessing introgression where geographic patterns are complex. The geographic axis of introgression is replaced with the hybrid index. We compare this, a recently proposed genomic clines approach, and two-dimensional (2D) geographic analyses, for 24 X chromosome loci of 2873 mice from the central-European house mouse HZ. In 2D, 14 loci show linear contact, seven precisely matching previous studies. Four show introgression islands to the east of the zone, suggesting past westward zone movement, two show westward salients. Barton's concordance both recovers and refines this information. A region of reduced introgression on the central X is supported, despite X centromere-proximal male-biased westward introgression matching a westward 2D geographic salient. Genomic clines results are consistent regarding introgression asymmetries, but otherwise more difficult to interpret. Evidence for genetic conflict is discussed.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are well-established for studying bacterial communities but not yet for microbial eukaryotes. Parasite communities remain poorly studied, due in part to the lack of reliable and accessible molecular methods to analyse eukaryotic communities. We aimed to develop and evaluate a methodology to analyse communities of the protozoan parasite Eimeria from populations of the Australian marsupial Petrogale penicillata (brush-tailed rock-wallaby) using NGS. An oocyst purification method for small sample sizes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol for the 18S rRNA locus targeting Eimeria was developed and optimised prior to sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. A data analysis approach was developed by modifying methods from bacterial metagenomics and utilising existing Eimeria sequences in GenBank. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) assignment at a high similarity threshold (97\%) was more accurate at assigning Eimeria contigs into Eimeria OTUs but at a lower threshold (95\%) there was greater resolution between OTU consensus sequences. The assessment of two amplification PCR methods prior to Illumina MiSeq, single and nested PCR, determined that single PCR was more sensitive to Eimeria as more Eimeria OTUs were detected in single amplicons. We have developed a simple and cost-effective approach to a data analysis pipeline for community analysis of eukaryotic organisms using Eimeria communities as a model. The pipeline provides a basis for evaluation using other eukaryotic organisms and potential for diverse community analysis studies.},

	abstract = {Background
The intestinal microbiota is a complex and diverse ecosystem that plays a significant role in maintaining the health and well-being of the mammalian host. During the last decade focus has increased on the importance of intestinal bacteria. Several molecular methods can be applied to describe the composition of the microbiota. This study used a new approach, the Gut Microbiotassay: an assembly of 24 primer sets targeting the main phyla and taxonomically related subgroups of the intestinal microbiota, to be used with the high-throughput qPCR chip ‘Access Array 48.48′, AA48.48, (Fluidigm®) followed by next generation sequencing. Primers were designed if necessary and all primer sets were screened against DNA extracted from pure cultures of 15 representative bacterial species. Subsequently the setup was tested on DNA extracted from small and large intestinal content from piglets with and without diarrhoea. The PCR amplicons from the 2304 reaction chambers were harvested from the AA48.48, purified, and sequenced using 454-technology.

Results
The Gut Microbiotassay was able to detect significant differences in the quantity and composition of the microbiota according to gut sections and diarrhoeic status. 454-sequencing confirmed the specificity of the primer sets. Diarrhoea was associated with a reduced number of members from the genus Streptococcus, and in particular S. alactolyticus.

Conclusion
The Gut Microbiotassay provides fast and affordable high-throughput quantification of the bacterial composition in many samples and enables further descriptive taxonomic information if combined with 454-sequencing.},

We assayed seven microsatellite loci in 746 oocysts from 183 infected mosquito guts. Genetic polymorphism was very high in parasites isolated from both vector species. The expected heterozygosity (HE) was 0.79 in both species; the observed heterozygosities (HO) were 0.32 in A. funestus and 0.42 in A. gambiae, indicating considerable inbreeding within both vector species. Mean selfing (s) between genetically identical gametes was s = 0.33. Differences in the rate of inbreeding were statistically insignificant among sites and between the two vector species. As expected, because of the high rate of inbreeding, linkage disequilibrium was very high; it was significant for all 21 loci pairs in A. gambiae and for 15 of 21 pairs in A. funestus, although only two pairwise comparisons were between loci on the same chromosome. Overall, the genetic population structure of P. falciparum, as evaluated by F statistics, was predominantly clonal rather than panmictic, a population structure that facilitates the spread of antimalarial drug and vaccine resistance and thus may impair the effectiveness of malaria control efforts.},

	abstract = {The parasite Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most common parasites worldwide and is known for its unusual life cycle. It reproduces sexually inside its primary host—the cat—and produces eggs that are released in faeces. Other animals, most often rodents, can then become infected when they unknowingly eat the eggs while foraging. Once inside its new host, the parasite reproduces asexually until the rodent’s immune system begins to fight back. It then becomes semi-dormant and forms cysts within the brain and muscle cells of its host. In an added twist, the parasite also causes rodents to lose their fear of cats. This increases their chances of being caught and eaten, thereby helping the parasite to return to its primary host and complete its life cycle.

Previous work has shown that virulent strains of T. gondii can evade the host immune system in mice by secreting enzymes that inactivate immune-related proteins called IRG proteins. This prevents the infection being cleared and leads to death of the host within a few days. The existence of these virulent strains is intriguing because parasites that kill their host, and thus prevent their own reproduction, should be eliminated from the population. The fact that they are fairly common suggests that there must be a hitherto unknown mechanism that allows rodents to survive these virulent strains.

Lilue et al. now report the existence of such a mechanism in strains of mice found in the wild. In contrast to laboratory mice, wild mice produce IRG proteins that inhibit the enzymes secreted by the virulent strains of T. gondii . Moreover, the IRG genes in wild mice are highly variable, whereas laboratory mice all have virtually identical IRG genes.

By uncovering the complexity and variability of IRG genes in wild mice—complexity that has been lost from laboratory strains—Lilue et al. solve the conundrum of how highly virulent T. gondii strains can persist in the mouse population, and offer an explanation for the evolution of parasitic strains with differing levels of virulence.

In this review, we dissect the biological role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are fermentation end products of the intestinal microbiota, in host–pathogen interactions. SCFA exert an extensive influence on host physiology through nutritional, regulatory, and immunomodulatory functions and can also affect bacterial fitness as a form of acid stress. Moreover, SCFA act as a signal for virulence gene regulation in common enteric pathogens. Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of the chemical environment where the biology of the host, the microbiota, and the pathogen intersects, which provides a basis for designing effective infection prevention and control.},

Identification of new targets for metabolic diseases treatment or prevention is required. In this context, FIAF/ANGPTL4 appears as a crucial regulator of energy homeostasis. Lactobacilli are often considered to display beneficial effect for their hosts, acting on different regulatory pathways. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of several lactobacilli strains on Fiaf gene expression in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and on mice tissues to decipher the underlying mechanisms.

Subjects and Methods
Nineteen lactobacilli strains have been tested on HT–29 human intestinal epithelial cells for their ability to regulate Fiaf gene expression by RT-qPCR. In order to determine regulated pathways, we analysed the whole genome transcriptome of IECs. We then validated in vivo bacterial effects using C57BL/6 mono-colonized mice fed with normal chow.

Results
We identified one strain (Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCMI–4317) that modulated Fiaf expression in IECs. This regulation relied potentially on bacterial surface-exposed molecules and seemed to be PPAR-γ independent but PPAR-α dependent. Transcriptome functional analysis revealed that multiple pathways including cellular function and maintenance, lymphoid tissue structure and development, as well as lipid metabolism were regulated by this strain. The regulation of immune system and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism was also confirmed by overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms analysis. In vivo, circulating FIAF protein was increased by the strain but this phenomenon was not correlated with modulation Fiaf expression in tissues (except a trend in distal small intestine).

Conclusion
We showed that Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCMI–4317 induced Fiaf expression in human IECs, and increased circulating FIAF protein level in mice. Moreover, this effect was accompanied by transcriptome modulation of several pathways including immune response and metabolism in vitro.},

	abstract = {Wormy mice in a hybrid zone have been interpreted as evidence of low hybrid fitness, such that parasites contribute to species separation. However, because of its natural heterogeneity, observations of parasite load must be numerous with good field area coverage. We sampled 689 mice from 107 localities across the Bavaria-Bohemia region of the European house mouse hybrid zone and calculated their hybrid indices using 1401 diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We tested whether hybrids have greater or lesser diversity and load of parasite helminths than additive expectations, performing load analyses on the four most common taxa. We found hybrids have significantly reduced diversity and load of each of the commonest helminths; rarer helminths further support reduced load. Although within-locality comparisons have little power, randomization tests show the repeated pattern is unlikely to be due to local parasite heterogeneity, and simulations show a patch of low parasite diversity is unlikely to fall by chance just so in the field area, such that it produces the observed effects. Our data therefore contradict the idea that helminths reduce hybrid fitness through increased load. We discuss a vicariant Red Queen model that implies immune genes tracking parasites will escape Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities, generating hybrid variants untargeted by parasites.},

	abstract = {The obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites, e.g. Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium species, induce an IFNγ-driven induction of host indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan catabolism in the kynurenine pathway. Induction of IDO1 supposedly depletes cellular levels of tryptophan in host cells, which is proposed to inhibit the in vitro growth of auxotrophic pathogens. In vivo function of IDO during infections, however, is not clear, let alone controversial. We show that Eimeria falciformis, an apicomplexan parasite infecting the mouse caecum, induces IDO1 in the epithelial cells of the organ, and the enzyme expression coincides with the parasite development. The absence or inhibition of IDO1/2 and of two downstream enzymes in infected animals is detrimental to the Eimeria growth. The reduced parasite yield is not due to a lack of an immunosuppressive effect of IDO1 in the parasitized IDO1(-/-) or inhibitor-treated mice because they did not show an accentuated Th1 and IFNγ response. Noticeably, the parasite development is entirely rescued by xanthurenic acid, a by-product of tryptophan catabolism inducing exflagellation in male gametes of Plasmodium in the mosquito mid-gut. Our data demonstrate a conceptual subversion of the host defense (IFNγ, IDO) by an intracellular pathogen for progression of its natural life cycle. Besides, we show utility of E. falciformis, a monoxenous parasite of a well appreciated host, i.e. mouse, to identify in vivo factors underlying the parasite-host interactions.},

Moreover, the clones recorded appear to be stable over large geographical areas and long periods of time. A clonal population structure demands that the medical attributes of clones be separately characterized; ubiquitous clones call for priority characterization. Uniparental reproduction renders unsatisfactory Linnean taxonomy; this needs to be supplemented by the "natural clone" as an additional taxonomic unit, which is best defined by means of genetic markers.},

Evolutionary-genomic studies show that natural selection is only one of the forces that shape genome evolution and is not quantitatively dominant, whereas non-adaptive processes are much more prominent than previously suspected. Major contributions of horizontal gene transfer and diverse selfish genetic elements to genome evolution undermine the Tree of Life concept. An adequate depiction of evolution requires the more complex concept of a network or ‘forest’ of life. There is no consistent tendency of evolution towards increased genomic complexity, and when complexity increases, this appears to be a non-adaptive consequence of evolution under weak purifying selection rather than an adaptation. Several universals of genome evolution were discovered including the invariant distributions of evolutionary rates among orthologous genes from diverse genomes and of paralogous gene family sizes, and the negative correlation between gene expression level and sequence evolution rate. Simple, non-adaptive models of evolution explain some of these universals, suggesting that a new synthesis of evolutionary biology might become feasible in a not so remote future.},

Colonization of a novel antigenic environment by a species would be expected to alter the immune system. Animals that successfully adapt their immune responses will successfully colonize new locations. However, founder events associated with colonization by limited numbers of individuals from a source population will constrain adaptability. How these contradicting forces shape immunity in widely distributed species is unknown. The western house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) spread globally from the Indo-Pakistani cradle, often in association with human migration and settlement. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that wild-derived outbred laboratory populations of house mice from their original range (Iran) and historically recent European invasive populations (from France and Germany) present differences in immune functional diversity corresponding to recent historical founder events in Europe and movement to novel antigenic environments. We found that (1) European mice had lower total white blood cell (WBC) counts but higher immunoglobulin E concentrations than their Iranian counterparts, and (2) there were no significant differences in the measured immunological parameters among European populations. The results indicate that founder events in European mice and selection pressure exerted by the composition of local parasitic helminth communities underlie the observed patterns.},

	abstract = {The house mouse hybrid zone (HMHZ) is a species barrier thought to be maintained by a balance between dispersal and natural selection against hybrids. While the HMHZ is characterized by frequency discontinuities for some sex chromosome markers, there is an unexpected large-scale regional introgression of a Y chromosome across the barrier, in defiance of Haldane's rule. Recent work suggests that a major force maintaining the species barrier acts through sperm traits. Here, we test whether the Y chromosome penetration of the species barrier acts through sperm traits by assessing sperm characteristics of wild-caught males directly in a field laboratory set up in a Y introgression region of the HMHZ, later calculating the hybrid index of each male using 1401 diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found that both sperm count (SC) and sperm velocity were significantly reduced across the natural spectrum of hybrids. However, SC was more than rescued in the presence of the invading Y. Our results imply an asymmetric advantage for Y chromosome introgression consistent with the observed large-scale introgression. We suggest that selection on sperm-related traits probably explains a large component of patterns observed in the natural hybrid zone, including the Y chromosome penetration.},

Effective control strategies targeting P. vivax malaria is hindered by our limited understanding of vivax biology. Here we established the P. vivax transcriptome of the Intraerythrocytic Developmental Cycle (IDC) of two clinical isolates in high resolution by Illumina HiSeq platform. The detailed map of transcriptome generates new insights into regulatory mechanisms of individual genes and reveals their intimate relationship with specific biological functions. A transcriptional hotspot of vir genes observed on chromosome 2 suggests a potential active site modulating immune evasion of the Plasmodium parasite across patients. Compared to other eukaryotes, P. vivax genes tend to have unusually long 5′ untranslated regions and also present multiple transcription start sites. In contrast, alternative splicing is rare in P. vivax but its association with the late schizont stage suggests some of its significance for gene function. The newly identified transcripts, including up to 179 vir like genes and 3018 noncoding RNAs suggest an important role of these gene/transcript classes in strain specific transcriptional regulation.},

	abstract = {* Comparative studies of captive primates and carnivores have shown a positive correlation between total white blood cell (WBC) counts and the level of inferred mating promiscuity (e.g. using testes mass). This correlation has been interpreted to support the ‘sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)’ hypothesis, which states that differential spread of STDs is caused by variation in mating behaviour which shapes baseline aspects of the immune system in mammals.


* In the present study, we tested the STDs hypothesis in rodents using 28 species from free-ranging and 9 species from captive populations. We compiled data set for the 9 studies of captive rodent populations from the International Species Information System (ISIS) and gathered 136 studies of wild populations from the literature.


* Using phylogenetic generalized least-squares statistical models considering non-independence resulting from shared ancestry, we confirmed that species with greater adult body mass averaged across sexes had elevated total WBC and differential WBC (neutrophils and lymphocytes) counts and that captive animals presented higher lymphocyte counts than free-ranging ones.


* However, we found that the total and differential WBC counts did not covary with the residual testes mass – a correlate of mating promiscuity. The results suggest that selection pressures caused by STDs may strongly vary among taxonomic groups. In order to determine the drivers of immunological variation among mammals, further comparative immunological studies including a wide range of taxonomic groups and socio-ecological variables should be performed and we recommend doing so by primarily focusing on free-ranging animals.},

To address this gap, we evaluated the effects of single doses of TcdA and/or TcdB injected into the ceca of mice, and several endpoints were analyzed, including tissue pathology, neutrophil infiltration, epithelial-layer gene expression, chemokine levels, and blood cell counts, 2, 6, and 16 h after injection. In addition to confirming TcdA's gross pathological effects, we found that both TcdA and TcdB resulted in neutrophil infiltration. Bioinformatics analyses identified altered expression of genes associated with the metabolism of lipids, fatty acids, and detoxification; small GTPase activity; and immune function and inflammation. Further analysis revealed transient expression of several chemokines (e.g., Cxcl1 and Cxcl2). Antibody neutralization of CXCL1 and CXCL2 did not affect TcdA-induced local pathology or neutrophil infiltration, but it did decrease the peripheral blood neutrophil count. Additionally, low serum levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2 corresponded with greater survival. Although TcdA induced more pronounced transcriptional changes than TcdB and the upregulated chemokine expression was unique to TcdA, the overall transcriptional responses to TcdA and TcdB were strongly correlated, supporting differences primarily in timing and potency rather than differences in the type of intracellular host response. In addition, the transcriptional data revealed novel toxin effects (e.g., altered expression of GTPase-associated and metabolic genes) underlying observed physiological responses to C. difficile toxins.},

	abstract = {Background
A close match of the HLA alleles between donor and recipient is an important prerequisite for successful unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To increase the chances of finding an unrelated donor, registries recruit many hundred thousands of volunteers each year. Many registries with limited resources have had to find a trade-off between cost and resolution and extent of typing for newly recruited donors in the past. Therefore, we have taken advantage of recent improvements in NGS to develop a workflow for low-cost, high-resolution HLA typing.

Results
We have established a straightforward three-step workflow for high-throughput HLA typing: Exons 2 and 3 of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 and -DPB1 are amplified by PCR on Fluidigm Access Array microfluidic chips. Illumina sequencing adapters and sample specific tags are directly incorporated during PCR. Upon pooling and cleanup, 384 samples are sequenced in a single Illumina MiSeq run. We developed “neXtype” for streamlined data analysis and HLA allele assignment. The workflow was validated with 1140 samples typed at 6 loci. All neXtype results were concordant with the Sanger sequences, demonstrating error-free typing of more than 6000 HLA loci. Current capacity in routine operation is 12,000 samples per week.

Conclusions
The workflow presented proved to be a cost-efficient alternative to Sanger sequencing for high-throughput HLA typing. Despite the focus on cost efficiency, resolution exceeds the current standards of Sanger typing for donor registration.},

Unlike Eimeria, a single-host enteric pathogen, Sarcocystis, Neospora, and Toxoplasma are two-host parasites that infect and produce infectious tissue cysts in a wide range of intermediate hosts. As a genus, Sarcocystis is one of the most successful protozoan parasites; all vertebrates, including birds, reptiles, fish, and mammals are hosts to at least one Sarcocystis species. Here we sequenced Sarcocystis neurona, the causal agent of fatal equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. The S. neurona genome is 127 Mbp, more than twice the size of other sequenced coccidian genomes. Comparative analyses identified conservation of the invasion machinery among the coccidia. However, many dense-granule and rhoptry kinase genes, responsible for altering host effector pathways in Toxoplasma and Neospora, are absent from S. neurona. Further, S. neurona has a divergent repertoire of SRS proteins, previously implicated in tissue cyst formation in Toxoplasma. Systems-based analyses identified a series of metabolic innovations, including the ability to exploit alternative sources of energy. Finally, we present an S. neurona model detailing conserved molecular innovations that promote the transition from a purely enteric lifestyle (Eimeria) to a heteroxenous parasite capable of infecting a wide range of intermediate hosts., Sarcocystis neurona is a member of the coccidia, a clade of single-celled apicomplexan parasites responsible for major economic and health care burdens worldwide. A cousin of Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium, Theileria, and Eimeria, Sarcocystis is one of the most successful parasite genera; it is capable of infecting all vertebrates (fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals—including humans). The past decade has witnessed an increasing number of human outbreaks of clinical significance associated with acute sarcocystosis. Among Sarcocystis species, S. neurona has a wide host range and causes fatal encephalitis in horses, marine mammals, and several other mammals. To provide insights into the transition from a purely enteric parasite (e.g., Eimeria) to one that forms tissue cysts (Toxoplasma), we present the first genome sequence of S. neurona.

This study focuses on  Trypanosoma cruzi , the vector-borne protozoan parasite responsible for human Chagas disease and the leading cause of infectious myocarditis worldwide. To gain global insights into the biology of this parasite and its interaction with mammalian host cells, we have exploited a deep-sequencing approach to generate comprehensive, high-resolution transcriptomic maps for mammalian-infective stages of  T .  cruzi  with the simultaneous interrogation of the human host cell transcriptome across an infection time course. We demonstrate that the establishment of intracellular  T .  cruzi  infection in mammalian host cells is accompanied by extensive remodeling of the parasite and host cell transcriptomes. Despite the lack of transcriptional control mechanisms in trypanosomatids, our analyses identified functionally-enriched processes within sets of developmentally-regulated transcripts in  T .  cruzi  that align with known or predicted biological features of the parasite. The novel insights into the biology of intracellular  T .  cruzi  infection and the regulation of amastigote development gained in this study establish a unique foundation for functional network analyses that will be instrumental in providing functional links between parasite dependencies and host functional pathways that have the potential to be exploited for intervention.},

	abstract = {In the field of infectious diseases the multifaceted amino acid arginine has reached special attention as substrate for the hosts production of the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (NO). A variety of infectious organisms interfere with this part of the host immune response by reducing the availability of arginine. This prompted us to further investigate additional roles of arginine during pathogen infections. As a model we used the intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis that actively consumes arginine as main energy source and secretes an arginine-consuming enzyme, arginine deiminase (ADI). Reduced intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation is a common theme during bacterial and viral intestinal infections, but it has never been connected to arginine-consumption. Our specific question was thereby, whether the arginine-consumption by Giardia leads to reduced IEC proliferation, in addition to NO reduction. In vitro cultivation of human IEC lines in arginine-free or arginine/citrulline-complemented medium, as well as in interaction with different G. intestinalis isolates, were used to study effects on host cell replication by MTT assay. IEC proliferation was further analyzed by DNA content analysis, polyamine measurements and expressional analysis of cell cycle regulatory genes. IEC proliferation was reduced upon arginine-withdrawal and also in an arginine-dependent manner upon interaction with G. intestinalis or addition of Giardia ADI. We show that arginine-withdrawal by intestinal pathogens leads to a halt in the cell cycle in IECs through reduced polyamine levels and upregulated cell cycle inhibitory genes. This is of importance with regards to intestinal tissue homeostasis that is affected through reduced cell proliferation. Thus, the slower epithelial cell turnover helps the pathogen to maintain a more stable niche for colonization. This study also shows why supplementation therapy of diarrhea patients with arginine/citrulline is helpful and that citrulline especially should gain further attention in future treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {The completion of the genome sequence of Trypanosoma cruzi has been followed by several studies of protein expression, with the long-term aim to obtain a complete picture of the parasite proteome. We report a proteomic analysis of an organellar cell fraction from T. cruzi CL Brener epimastigotes. A total of 396 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS. Of these, 138 were annotated as hypothetical in the genome databases and the rest could be assigned to several metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, transport, and structural functions. Comparative analysis with a whole cell proteome study resulted in the validation of the expression of 173 additional proteins. Of these, 38 proteins previously reported in other stages were not found in the only large-scale study of the total epimastigote stage proteome. A selected set of identified proteins was analyzed further to investigate gene copy number, sequence variation, transmembrane domains and targeting signals. The genes were cloned and the proteins expressed with a c-myc epitope tag in T. cruzi epimastigotes. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the localization of these proteins in different cellular compartments, such as endoplasmic reticulum, acidocalcisome, mitochondrion, and putative cytoplasmic transport or delivery vesicles. The results demonstrate that the use of enriched subcellular fractions allows the detection of T. cruzi proteins that are undetected by whole cell proteomic methods.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-016-2444-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Theileria parva is an intracellular parasite that causes a lymphoproliferative disease in cattle. It does so by inducing cancer-like phenotypes in the host cells it infects, although the molecular and regulatory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. RNAseq data, and the resulting updated genome annotation now available for this parasite, offer an unprecedented opportunity to characterize the genomic features associated with gene regulation in this species. Our previous analyses revealed a T. parva genome even more gene-dense than previously thought, with many adjacent loci overlapping each other, not only at the level of untranslated sequences (UTRs) but even in coding sequences.
RESULTS: Despite this compactness, Theileria intergenic regions show a pattern of size distribution indicative of monocistronic gene transcription. Three previously described motifs are conserved among Theileria species and highly prevalent in promoter regions near or at the transcription start sites. We found novel motifs at many transcription termination sites, as well as upstream of parasite genes thought to be critical for host transformation. Adjacent genes that could be regulated by antisense transcription from an overlapping transcriptional unit are syntenic between T. parva and P. falciparum at a frequency higher than expected by chance, suggesting the presence of common, and evolutionary old, regulatory mechanisms in the phylum Apicomplexa.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model of transcription with conserved sense and antisense transcription from a few taxonomically ubiquitous and several species-specific promoter motifs. Interestingly, the gene networks regulated by conserved promoters are themselves, in most cases, not conserved between species or genera.},

Progress in identifying the heritable basis for clinically and epidemiologically significant differences requires a robust system for describing and interpreting evolutionary subdivisions in this prevalent pathogen. To develop such a system, we have examined more than 950 isolates collected from around the world and genotyped them using three independent sets of polymorphic DNA markers, sampling 30 loci distributed across all nuclear chromosomes as well as the plastid genome. Our studies reveal a biphasic pattern consisting of regions in the Northern Hemisphere where a few, highly clonal and abundant lineages predominate; elsewhere, and especially in portions of South America are characterized by a diverse assemblage of less common genotypes that show greater evidence of recombination. Clustering methods were used to organize the marked genetic diversity of 138 unique genotypes into 15 haplogroups that collectively define six major clades. Analysis of gene flow indicates that a small number of ancestral lineages gave rise to the existing diversity through a process of limited admixture. Identification of reference strains for these major groups should facilitate future studies on comparative genomics and identification of genes that control important biological phenotypes including pathogenesis and transmission.},

One apicomplexan-wide family of microneme proteins has been identified with members that are characterised by the possession of thrombospondin type I repeats, conserved adhesive motifs which are implicated in binding to glycosaminoglycan chains. In this paper we describe a micronemal glycoprotein, EtMIC 5, from Eimeria tenella which contains eleven cysteine-rich motifs that have striking similarity to the adhesive Apple (A-) domains of blood coagulation factor XI and plasma pre-kallikrein. EtMIC 5 is confined to an intracellular location in resting sporozoites but is translocated to the parasite surface and secreted into the culture supernatant during parasite infection of MDBK cells. During intracellular replication, the protein is switched off in early schizogony and is then re-expressed within the apical tips of newly formed merozoites. A-domain sequences were also found in microneme proteins from Sarcocystis muris and Toxoplasma gondii and in a protein of unknown localisation from Eimeria acervulina. These studies suggest that A-domain containing proteins may comprise a novel apicomplexan-wide family of microneme adhesins.},

After the first challenge infection, none of the immunized mice showed clinical signs of coccidiosis; a few mice passed very low numbers of oocysts, and oocyst discharge seemed to correlate negatively with immunizing dose. None of the mice immunized twice passed oocysts after challenge. Mice immunized with three infections were completely immune to challenge for 4 months. The effect of the immune response on the life cycle of the coccidium was determined by histological examination of the intestines of immune and nonimmune mice infected with the parasite. In both the immune and nonimmune groups, sporozoites penetrated absorptive epithelial cells and migrated to crypt epithelial cells during the first 6 to 24 h postinfection. At 48 to 72 h postinfection, the sporozoites developed into mature first-generation schizonts in the nonimmune mice, whereas the developing first-generation schizonts degenerated within the crypt epithelial cells of the immune mice. In nonimmune mice, third-generation merozoites, inoculated intracecally, developed into mature fourth-generation schizonts, whereas in immune mice the developing fourth-generation schizonts degenerated before maturing. The possibility that a cellmediated immune mechanism is responsible for the arrest in schizogony is discussed.},

When bradyzoites are ingested by felids, they transform into merozoites in enterocytes and expand asexually as part of their coccidian life cycle. In all other intermediate hosts, however, bradyzoites differentiate exclusively to tachyzoites, and disseminate extraintestinally to many cell types.

Necator americanus was found to be the commonest helminth infection, with a prevalence of near 100\% and intensity of 40 worms per host in adults. Enterobius vermicularis, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura were also present, at prevalences of 53, 10 and 3\% respectively; Ancylostoma duodenale was absent. The frequency distribution of N. americanus was highly over-dispersed, and was well described by a negative binomial distribution with aggregation parameter, k, of 0.370. Intensity of infection was significantly related to host age, but did not differ between the sexes. Haemoglobin levels and haematocrit values were indicative of anaemia in the community, but were unrelated to hookworm infection. Levels of antibodies (IgG, IgA and IgM combined) against adult Necator cuticular collagen and excretory-secretory (ES) products were determined. Serum concentrations of the two types of antibody were significantly correlated with each other. Significant positive correlations were found between anti-ES antibody levels and hookworm egg production, and between anti-collagen antibody levels and host age. It is suggested that the level of anti-collagen antibodies may reflect cumulative exposure to infection, whereas levels of anti-ES antibodies may be more dependent on current worm burden. No evidence was found to suggest that either antibody response is important in regulating parasite population growth. Similarly, the presence of a positive correlation between eosinophil concentration and infection intensity in adults indicates that eosinophilia reflects, rather than determines, the host's worm burden.},

This volume consists of 14 chapters and begins with an overview of mice of the genus Mus and problems concerning evolution within the genus. The following chapters focus on taxonomy, nomenclature, and breeding systems, together with recombinant inbred and congenic resistant mouse strains. Methods of constructing, testing, and monitoring strains are described. Congenic strains, gene mapping, cytogenetics, and murine experimental studies are also considered, along with the histocompatibility-2 complex and radiation genetics. The final chapter is devoted to the pharmacogenetics of the laboratory mouse, paying particular attention to intoxication and detoxication pathways, genetically determined differences in xenobiotic metabolism, and pharmacogenetic polymorphisms.

	abstract = {In the light of available paleontological, genetic, and ecological data, we attempt to reconstruct the natural history of the house mouse (Mus musculus) and to justify a systematics. The house mouse is the most recent phylogenetic offshoot of the genus Mus. Its present components result from a radiation that took place most probably in the north of the Indian subcontinent about 0.5 MYA. The different colonization paths into the rest of Eurasia led to the present day subspecies: M. m. domesticus in western Europe and the Mediterranean basin, M. m. musculus from central Europe to northern China, and M. m. castaneus in southeast Asia. The central populations remain very polymorphic and are not attributable to any of these subspecies; the status of M. m. bactrianus is unclear. This radiation led to a mosaic evolution of the different parts of the genome in these subspecies. The expansion to the periphery of the Eurasian range, and more recently to the rest of the world, is related to human activity. In the case of M. m. domesticus commensalism apparently started with human sedentism in the Fertile Crescent, but its extension to the western Meditteranean basin occurred only after Neolithic times. The recent expansion has produced zones of secondary contact at the periphery of the continent. For instance, in Europe M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus have formed a narrow hybrid zone where selection prevents the introgression of sex chromosomes. M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus have extensively mixed in the Japanese archipelago, and intergrade in central China. The house mouse thus offers a series of replicates of the process of geographic speciation. Commensalism with humans has modified the population structure mainly through fragmentation of populations and high local densities. Possibly in relation to this way of life, M. m. domesticus has evolved many populations with various combinations of Robertsonian translocations, a choice model to study stasipatric speciation. Finally its commensalism has led to its domestication in the form of laboratory strains, which have a polyphyletic origin.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00442-005-0314-y},
	abstract = {The evidence for a relationship between life history and immune defense is equivocal, although the basic premise is intuitively appealing: animals that live short lives and reproduce early and rapidly should not waste resources on defenses they might never use. One possible reason for a lack of strong support for this hypothesis could be the inherent complexity of the vertebrate immune system. Indeed, different components of the vertebrate immune system vary in their relative costs and benefits, and therefore only some defenses may complement variation in species' life history. To address this hypothesis, we compared multiple types of immune activity between two populations of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with distinct life histories, one from Colon, Panama, which lay small clutches over an extended breeding season (i.e., slow-living) and the other from Princeton, New Jersey, which lay larger clutches in a smaller window of time (i.e., fast-living). We expected (a) that more costly types of immune defenses would be stronger in the slow-living sparrows and (2) that the slow-living sparrows would show a greater increase in whole-body energy expenditure after immune challenge compared to their fast-living counterparts. We found that secondary antibody response to a novel antigen was more rapid and energetic investment in immune activity was greater in slow-living sparrows. However, cell-mediated immune activity was more robust in fast-living sparrows, and other measures of defense were not different between populations. These results provide partial support for a relationship between life history and immune defense in this species, but they also indicate that this relationship is not clear-cut. Further study is necessary to identify the influence of other factors, particular pathogen environment during development, on the architecture of the immune system of wild animals.},

	abstract = {It was recently hypothesised that specific induced defences, which require substantial time and resources and are mostly beneficial against repeated infections, are more likely to be favoured in ‘slow-living-pace’ species. Therefore, understanding how different types of immune defences might vary with life history requires knowledge of the costs and benefits of defence components. Studies that have explored the energetic costs of immunity in vertebrates have done so with a focus primarily on birds and less so on mammals, particularly surface-dwelling rodents. In this study, we evaluated whether an experimental induction of the immune system with a non-pathogenic antigen elevates the energetic expenditure of a subterranean rodent: Ctenomys talarum (tuco-tucos). In both seasons studied, a significant increase in oxygen consumption was verified in immune-challenged tuco-tucos injected with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) compared with control animals. The increase in oxygen consumption 10 days after the exposure to SRBC was lower for female tuco-tucos monitored in the breeding season compared with females in the non-breeding season. Interestingly, antibody titres of female tuco-tucos did not decrease during the breeding season. Our results add new insight into the role of other factors such as basal metabolic rate or degree of parasite exposure besides ‘pace of life’ in modulating the interspecific immunological variation observed in natural populations of mammals.

	abstract = {Včasné rozpoznání patogenů je zásadní pro efektivní imunitní odpověď, zajišťující aktivaci adekvátních obranných mechanismů. U obratlovců je obecně zdokumentováno, že molekuly adaptivní imunity, které se účastní rozpoznání patogenů, jsou často předmětem intenzivních selekčních tlaků. Naopak mnohem méně údajů je známo o selekci působící na receptory vrozené imunity. Cílem této práce je popsat variabilitu genů vrozené imunity, které se účastní detekce patogenů u volně žijících hlodavců a odhalit, které selekční síly na ně během evoluce působily. Práce je zaměřena na podčeleď Murinae, jelikož často žijí v bezprostřední blízkosti lidí a jsou potencionálními nositeli různých pro člověka nebezpečných patogenů. Nejprve jsem studovala vnitrodruhovou variabilitu pěti anti-bakteriálních Toll-like receptorů (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 a TLR6) u inbredních linií myši domácí, které byly odvozeny z populací volně žijících zvířat. Tyto kmeny jsou vhodným nástrojem pro studování variability imunitních genů, jelikož nám poskytují informaci o alelách, které se v přirozené populaci vyskytují, a zároveň je možné vhodně využít homozygotních genotypů u inbredních jedinců. Výsledkem této části bylo popsání polymorfismu pěti genů TLR u dvou poddruhů myši domácí (Mus musculus musculus, Mmm a M. m. domesticus, Mmd). K nejzajímavějším výsledkům patřilo zjištění stop kodonu v exonu 2 u Tlr5 a nulová variabilita Tlr4 u Mmd. Tato část práce zároveň poskytla sadu diagnostických SNPs, které mohou být využity ke studiu introgrese Tlr genů přes hybridní zónu domácích myší a ke stanovení vlivu jejich polymorfismu na speciační procesy. Na tento výsledek jsme navázali další studií, kdy jsme se rozhodli ověřit, zda nízká variabilita Tlr4 u Mmd je reálným odrazem variability přírodních populací, či se jedná o nepřirozenou odchylku způsobenou nedostatečným vzorkováním či následným inbredním křížením. Osekvenovali jsme tedy Tlr4 u obou poddruhů z velké části jejich výskytu v západním Palearktu (celkem 39 Mmm a 62 Mmd) a srovnali variabilitu Tlr4 se znakem na mitochondriální DNA. Hlavním výsledkem bylo potvrzení hypotézy, že variabilita u Mmd je oproti Mmm opravdu radikálně snížena, pravděpodobně vlivem silné selekce způsobené patogeny, se kterými se během kolonizační cesty tento poddruh potkal. Vliv náhodných evolučních mechanismů (např. genetický drift při opakovaných sníženích efektivní velikosti populace) však nemůže být na základě našich dat zcela vyloučen. Dále jsme zjistili, že oba poddruhy mají zcela odlišné Tlr4 varianty, a že u Mmm je variabilita Tlr4 udržována i mechanismem rekombinace. Poslední část disertace je věnována mezidruhovému srovnání dvou receptorů (TLR4 a TLR7). Ty se liší jednak lokalizací v buňce a jednak schopností detekce odlišných ligandů. TLR4 patří mezi extracelulární receptory detekující hlavně bakteriální ligandy (především lipopolysacharidy), zatímco TLR7 je lokalizován na vnitrobuněčných membránách a detekuje ssRNA virů. Cílem mezidruhového srovnání bylo popsat variabilitu obou zmíněných receptorů a působení selekce během evoluce obou TLR. Celkem bylo pro analýzu použito 23 druhů hlodavců z podčeledi Murinae z Evropy, Asie a Afriky. Přestože se obě molekuly vyvíjejí především pod vlivem purifikující selekce, která eliminuje negativní mutace a udržuje funkčnost receptorů, některé jejich části vykazovaly znaky pozitivní selekce. Místa pod pozitivní selekcí byla koncentrována především v extracelulární části obou receptorů, která je zodpovědná za rozpoznání patogenů. Následným srovnáním obou TLR jsme zjistili, že intracelulární TLR7 je pod mnohem větším negativním selekčním tlakem, neboť rozpoznává virové nukleové kyseliny, které jsou značně podobné hostitelským molekulám, a jakákoliv i drobná změna by mohla vést k autoimunitním poruchám.},

	abstract = {Different species have often evolved from a common ancestor. In order to become distinct species, however, the different groups of descendants of that ancestor must have become isolated from one another at some point in their history so that they could no longer mate or reproduce. For example, a mountain or a river might create a physical barrier that keeps species apart, so that if the species meet up again they may struggle to mate or produce offspring. Furthermore, any ‘hybrid’ offspring that are produced may themselves struggle to survive or successfully reproduce. Examining the genes of the hybrid offspring that result when two recently separated species crossbreed could help us to understand how new species evolve. However, the challenges of finding enough suitable hybrids to compare means that few studies have so far investigated the genetic changes that occur to make reproduction between separate species difficult. Two subspecies of the house mouse—Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus—live alongside each other in a region of central Europe and can mate and produce hybrid offspring. Male hybrid mice are commonly less fertile than non-hybrids; this acts as a barrier to reproductive success that helps to maintain the separation between the two subspecies. Turner and Harr captured wild hybrid mice, bred them in the laboratory, and studied their offspring. This strategy enabled them to measure fertility in mice very similar to wild-caught hybrids, but now all individuals can be measured at the same age and under the same environmental conditions. A method called a genome-wide association study can be used to survey the genes of individuals with a particular disease or physical characteristic in an effort to identify gene variants that are associated with that condition. In many species, the weight of a male's testes has been linked to their fertility—small testes mean the male is likely to be less fertile. Changes in how genes are ‘expressed’ in the testes can also reduce fertility. Turner and Harr used a genome-wide association study to investigate which genetic changes are linked to changes in testis weight or how genes in the testes are expressed in the offspring of hybrid mice. This revealed that many separate genetic regions are involved; including some that had not previously been identified. Turner and Harr then examined how these gene regions interact with each other. With the exception of one gene, all interacted with at least one of the other genetic regions that had been identified, forming a complex network of interactions. Although a genome-wide association study reveals which genes are altered in hybrid mice with small testes, it does not reveal which of these genes actually cause the changes in testis size and gene expression. However, the work of Turner and Harr greatly narrows down the candidates for further investigation.},

	abstract = {Interactions between nutrition and immunity are diverse and have profound implications on animal growth and productivity. The innate immune system provides protection during the initial stages of infection and is responsible for mediating many of the alterations in nutrient metabolism. The macrophage is the key sensory and regulatory cell of the innate immune system. Their pro-inflammatory cytokines coordinate local immunity to pathogens, yet also act systemically to alter metabolic homeostasis and decrease food intake and growth rate. Altered energy, amino acid, lipid, and mineral metabolism have nutritionally important implications. For example, an innate immune response results in decreased uptake of amino acids by skeletal muscles and a corresponding increase in uptake by the liver and to a lesser extent by leukocytes. The net result is a decrease in amino acid requirements with no change in the efficiency of their use for growth. The shift in the priority of individual tissues for nutrients appears to be accomplished by changes in the types and amounts of their nutrient transporters and storage proteins. Adaptive immune responses result in considerably more subtle changes in nutrient metabolism than innate responses.},

The asexual intracellular development stage, the merozoite, was specifically examined, and we used expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis to provide experimental evidence of transcription and a framework for understanding the merozoite stage of E. maxima . Of 2,680 individual ESTs obtained, 48.2\% shared most significant (E {\textless} 10(-5)) homology to sequences from other apicomplexan species, primarily other Eimeria spp. and Toxoplasma gondii , and 47.5\% were unique. Annotation of these ESTs enabled categorization to putative biological function and revealed an emphasis on translation, cytoskeleton, metabolism, signaling, transport, and protein folding, as well as the apicomplexan specific surface antigens and micronemes. Comparative analysis of abundantly expressed transcripts from merozoites of the 3 Eimeria spp. revealed a novel transcript common to all 3. Sharing no significant homology to any other sequence in public databases, this transcript was predicted to encode an Eimeria -specific protein (ESP) with 166-178 amino acids and 58.9-65.1\% interspecific identity. A predicted signal peptide was identified, consistent with the assumption that ESP is a secreted protein. These annotated ESTs from E. maxima merozoites provide a resource for intra- and interspecific comparative analyses that will be useful in distinguishing the unique biology of coccidian parasites in relation to the diverse phylum of Apicomplexa.},

	abstract = {Hypothetical proteins comprise roughly half of the predicted gene complement of  Toxoplasma gondii  and  Plasmodium falciparum  and represent the largest class of uniquely functioning proteins in these parasites. Following the idea that functional relationships can be informed by the timing of gene expression, we devised a strategy to identify the core set of apicomplexan cell division cycling genes with important roles in parasite division, which includes many uncharacterized proteins. We assembled an expanded list of orthologs from the  T. gondii  and  P. falciparum  genome sequences (2781 putative orthologs), compared their mRNA profiles during synchronous replication, and sorted the resulting set of dual cell cycle regulated orthologs (744 total) into protein pairs conserved across many eukaryotic families versus those unique to the Apicomplexa. The analysis identified more than 100 ortholog gene pairs with unknown function in  T. gondii  and  P. falciparum  that displayed co-conserved mRNA abundance, dynamics of cyclical expression and similar peak timing that spanned the complete division cycle in each parasite. The unknown cyclical mRNAs encoded a diverse set of proteins with a wide range of mass and showed a remarkable conservation in the internal organization of ordered versus disordered structural domains. A representative sample of cyclical unknown genes (16 total) was epitope tagged in  T. gondii  tachyzoites yielding the discovery of new protein constituents of the parasite inner membrane complex, key mitotic structures and invasion organelles. These results demonstrate the utility of using gene expression timing and dynamic profile to identify proteins with unique roles in Apicomplexa biology.},

Uniform processing and comprehensive annotation of these data allow comparison across metazoan phyla, extending beyond earlier within-phylum transcriptome comparisons and revealing ancient, conserved features. Specifically, we discover co-expression modules shared across animals, many of which are enriched in developmental genes. Moreover, we use expression patterns to align the stages in worm and fly development and find a novel pairing between worm embryo and fly pupae, in addition to the embryo-to-embryo and larvae-to-larvae pairings. Furthermore, we find that the extent of non-canonical, non-coding transcription is similar in each organism, per base pair. Finally, we find in all three organisms that the gene-expression levels, both coding and non-coding, can be quantitatively predicted from chromatin features at the promoter using a /`universal model/' based on a single set of organism-independent parameters.},

Coccidiosis, caused by apicomplexan protozoa of the genus Eimeria, is one of the most important poultry diseases. Understanding the biology of Eimeria parasites underpins development of new drugs and vaccines needed to improve global food security. We have produced annotated genome sequences of all seven species of Eimeria that infect domestic chickens, which reveal the full extent of previously described repeat-rich and repeat-poor regions and show that these parasites possess the most repeat-rich proteomes ever described. Furthermore, while no other apicomplexan has been found to possess retrotransposons, Eimeria is home to a family of chromoviruses. Analysis of Eimeria genes involved in basic biology and host-parasite interaction highlights adaptations to a relatively simple developmental life cycle and a complex array of co-expressed surface proteins involved in host cell binding.},

	abstract = {Coccidiosis of the domestic fowl is a worldwide disease caused by seven species of protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria. The genome of the model species, Eimeria tenella, presents a complexity of 55–60 MB distributed in 14 chromosomes. Relatively few studies have been undertaken to unravel the complexity of the transcriptome of Eimeria parasites. We report here the generation of more than 45,000 open reading frame expressed sequence tag (ORESTES) cDNA reads of E. tenella, Eimeria maxima and Eimeria acervulina, covering several developmental stages: unsporulated oocysts, sporoblastic oocysts, sporulated oocysts, sporozoites and second generation merozoites. All reads were assembled to constitute gene indices and submitted to a comprehensive functional annotation pipeline. In the case of E. tenella, we also incorporated publicly available ESTs to generate an integrated body of information. Orthology analyses have identified genes conserved across different apicomplexan parasites, as well as genes restricted to the genus Eimeria. Digital expression profiles obtained from ORESTES/EST countings, submitted to clustering analyses, revealed a high conservation pattern across the three Eimeria spp. Distance trees showed that unsporulated and sporoblastic oocysts constitute a distinct clade in all species, with sporulated oocysts forming a more external branch. This latter stage also shows a close relationship with sporozoites, whereas first and second generation merozoites are more closely related to each other than to sporozoites. The profiles were unambiguously associated with the distinct developmental stages and strongly correlated with the order of the stages in the parasite life cycle. Finally, we present The Eimeria Transcript Database (http://www.coccidia.icb.usp.br/eimeriatdb), a website that provides open access to all sequencing data, annotation and comparative analysis. We expect this repository to represent a useful resource to the Eimeria scientific community, helping to define potential candidates for the development of new strategies to control coccidiosis of the domestic fowl.},

Chicks were fed isocaloric diets containing 8, 15, or 33\% protein over a three-week period. Significant reductions in the rate of body growth were evident in chicks receiving 8 and 15\% protein. Development of the bursa of Fabricius and spleen was significantly depressed in the 8\% protein group compared to the other two treatments. Lymphocyte yields from dissociated lymphoid organs of chicks fed 8\% protein were substantially reduced compared to birds fed higher levels of protein. In vitro lymphoproliferative responses of cultured splenocytes to mitogenic stimulation (concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, and Salmonella typhimurium), white-blood-cell counts, and in vivo measures of humoral immunity did not differ among dietary treatments. Cell-mediated immune function, as measured by an in vivo hypersensitivity response to an intradermal injection of a T lymphocyte-dependent mitogen (phytohemagglutinin), was significantly suppressed in the 8\% protein group compared to the other two treatments. Several measures of immune-system development and function were significantly correlated with body mass change during the trial. Results indicated that four-week-old Northern Bobwhite chicks fen an 8\% protein diet for three weeks may have difficulty expressing a competent immune response to pathogenic challenge in the wild.},

Over the past decade, an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work has been devoted to explaining this pattern. This work has falsified several once-popular theories and, more important, has produced a strong consensus on the likely causes of Haldane's rule. Experiments show that the dominance theory, which posits that "speciation genes" act as partial recessives in hybrids, can explain Haldane's rule for hybrid inviability. Dominance likely also contributes to Haldane's rule for sterility. Recent experiments further show that faster evolution of hybrid male steriles plays an important role. Faster evolution of X-linked loci may also contribute, though the evidence here is weaker. Evolutionary geneticists now largely agree that the simultaneous action of these forces explains Haldane's rule.},

Here I model speciation as the accumulation of genic incompatibilities between diverging populations. Several results are obtained. First, and most important, the number of genic incompatibilities between taxa increases much faster than linearly with time. In particular, the probability of speciation increases at least as fast as the square of the time since separation between two taxa. Second, as Muller realized, all hybrid incompatibilities must initially be asymmetric. Third, at loci that have diverged between taxa, evolutionarily derived alleles cause hybrid problems far more often than ancestral alleles. Last, it is "easier" to evolve complex hybrid incompatibilities requiring the simultaneous action of three or more loci than to evolve simple incompatibilities between pairs of genes. These results have several important implications for genetic analyses of speciation.},

Both morphological and sequence data (18S rDNA and ORF 470) showed low variability, indicating that all samples represent a single species. By comparison with published morphological descriptions of coccidia from glirid rodents, we determined that the samples represent Eimeria myoxi. Molecular data suggest that this species does not fall within the 2 known rodent-specific groups but branches as a third independent lineage. However, its exact position in respect to other eimerian clusters could not be established due to the lack of phylogenetic information at this taxonomic level for the 18S rRNA and ORF 470 genes. Based on these results, we provide a re-description of Eimeria myoxi, which contains morphological and molecular characteristics sufficient for its further unequivocal identification.},

	abstract = {We investigate the patterns of abundance-spatial occupancy relationships of adult parasite nematodes in mammal host populations (828 populations of nematodes from 66 different species of terrestrial mammals). A positive relationship between mean parasite abundance and host occupancy, i.e. prevalence, is found which suggests that local abundance is linked to spatial distribution across species. Moreover, the frequency distribution of the parasite prevalence is bimodal, which is consistent with a core-satellite species distribution. In addition, a strong positive relationship between the abundance (log-transformed) and its variance (log-transformed) is observed, the distribution of worm abundance being lognormally distributed when abundance values have been corrected for host body size.  Hanski et al. proposed three distinct hypotheses, which might account for the positive relationship between abundance and prevalence in free and associated organisms: 1) ecological specialisation, 2) sampling artefact, and 3) metapopulation dynamics. In addition, Gaston and co-workers listed five additional hypotheses. Four solutions were not applicable to our parasitological data due to the lack of relevant information in most host-parasite studies. The fifth hypothesis, i.e. the confounded effects exerted by common history on observed patterns of parasite distributions, was considered using a phylogeny-based comparison method. Testing the four possible hypotheses, we obtained the following results: 1) the variation of parasite distribution across host species is not due to phylogenetic confounding effects; 2) the positive relationship between mean abundance and prevalence of nematodes may not result from an ecological specialisation, i.e. host specificity, of these parasites; 3) both a positive abundance-prevalence relationship and a negative coefficient of variation of abundance-prevalence relationship are likely to occur which corroborates the sampling model developed by Hanski et al. We argue that demographic explanations may be of particular importance to explain the patterns of bimodality of prevalence when testing Monte-Carlo simulations using epidemiological modelling frameworks, and when considering empirical findings. We conclude that both the bimodal distribution of parasite prevalence and the mean-variance power function simply result from demographic and stochastic patterns (highlighted by the sampling model), which present compelling evidence that nematode parasite species might adjust their spatial distribution and burden in mammal hosts for simple epidemiological reasons.},

One crucial step in such studies is the clustering of sequences into  Operational Taxonomic Units  (OTUs) of closely related organisms. However, this practice has repeatedly been called into question, arguing that the use of OTUs is not backed by microbial speciation theory. Here, we explore whether OTUs group ecologically similar organisms and show that indeed, OTUs are generally ecologically consistent. Moreover, we show how ecological consistency can be used as a measure of OTU ‘quality’ and compare different widely used OTU clustering methods. Our findings should help in the design and interpretation of SSU-based microbial ecology studies, in a research field that is only beginning to unfold its full potential to help understand life at the smallest scales.},

Some of these differences seem to be determined by the stimulation history during memory cell formation. To induce rapid recall antibody responses, the contributions of other types of cells, such as memory T follicular helper cells, have also now begun to be appreciated. In this Review, we discuss these and other recent advances in our understanding of memory B cells, focusing on the underlying mechanisms that are required for rapid and effective recall antibody responses.

	abstract = {Faecal samples are of great value as a non-invasive means to gather information on the genetics, distribution, demography, diet and parasite infestation of endangered species. Direct shotgun sequencing of faecal DNA could give information on these simultaneously, but this approach is largely untested. Here, we used two faecal samples to characterize the diet of two red-shanked doucs langurs (Pygathrix nemaeus) that were fed known foliage, fruits, vegetables and cereals. Illumina HiSeq produced {\textasciitilde}74 and 67 million paired reads for these samples, of which {\textasciitilde}10 000 (0.014\%) and {\textasciitilde}44 000 (0.066\%), respectively, were of chloroplast origin. Sequences were matched against a database of available chloroplast ‘barcodes’ for angiosperms. The results were compared with ‘metabarcoding’ using PCR amplification of the P6 loop of trnL. Metagenomics identified seven and nine of the likely 16 diet plants while six and five were identified by metabarcoding. Metabarcoding produced thousands of reads consistent with the known diet, but the barcodes were too short to identify several plant species to genus. Metagenomics utilized multiple, longer barcodes that combined had greater power of identification. However, rare diet items were not recovered. Read numbers for diet species in metagenomic and metabarcoding data were correlated, indicating that both are useful for determining relative sequence abundance. Metagenomic reads were uniformly distributed across the chloroplast genomes; thus, if chloroplast genomes were used as reference, the precision of identifications and species recovery would improve further. Metagenomics also recovered the host mitochondrial genome and numerous intestinal parasite sequences in addition to generating data useful for characterizing the microbiome.},

We developed a method based on DNA metabarcoding multiplexing and next-generation sequencing to uncover different taxonomic groups of organisms from complex diet samples. We validated this approach on 91 faeces of a large omnivorous mammal, the brown bear, using DNA metabarcoding markers targeting the plant, vertebrate and invertebrate components of the diet. We included internal controls in the experiments and performed PCR replication for accuracy validation in postsequencing data analysis. Using our multiplexing strategy, we significantly simplified the experimental procedure and accurately and concurrently identified different prey DNA corresponding to the targeted taxonomic groups, with ≥ 60\% of taxa of all diet components identified to genus/species level. The systematic application of internal controls and replication was a useful and simple way to evaluate the performance of our experimental procedure, standardize the selection of sequence filtering parameters for each marker data and validate the accuracy of the results. Our general approach can be adapted to the analysis of dietary samples of various predator species in different ecosystems, for a number of conservation and ecological applications entailing large-scale population level diet assessment through cost-effective screening of multiple DNA metabarcodes, and the detection of fine dietary variation among samples or individuals and of rare food items.},

Ecological networks describe interactions between species, the underlying structure of communities and the function and stability of ecosystems. They provide the ability to assess the robustness of complex ecological communities to species loss, as well as a novel way of guiding restoration. However, empirically quantifying the interactions between entire communities remains a significant challenge.


* Concomitantly, advances in DNA sequencing technologies are resolving previously intractable questions in functional and taxonomic biodiversity and provide enormous potential to determine hitherto difficult to observe species interactions. Combining DNA metabarcoding approaches with ecological network analysis presents important new opportunities for understanding large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes, as well as providing powerful tools for building ecosystems that are resilient to environmental change.


* We propose a novel ‘nested tagging’ metabarcoding approach for the rapid construction of large, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks. Taking tree–insect–parasitoid ecological networks as an illustration, we show how measures of network robustness, constructed using DNA metabarcoding, can be used to determine the consequences of tree species loss within forests, and forest habitat loss within wider landscapes. By determining which species and habitats are important to network integrity, we propose new directions for forest management.


* Merging metabarcoding with ecological network analysis provides a revolutionary opportunity to construct some of the largest, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks to date, providing new ways to: (i) monitor biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; (ii) assess the robustness of interacting communities to species loss; and (iii) build ecosystems that are more resilient to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Bacteria, fungi and green algae are common inhabitants of coral skeletons. Their diversity is poorly characterized because they are difficult to identify with microscopy or environmental sequencing, as common metabarcoding markers have low phylogenetic resolution and miss a large portion of the biodiversity. We used a cost-effective protocol and a combination of markers (tufA, 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA and 23S rDNA) to characterize the microbiome of 132 coral skeleton samples. We identified a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, many never reported in corals before. We additionally investigated the phylogenetic diversity of the green algae-the most abundant eukaryotic member of this community, for which previous literature recognizes only a handful of endolithic species. We found more than 120 taxonomic units (near species level), including six family-level lineages mostly new to science. The results suggest that the existence of lineages with an endolithic lifestyle predates the existence of modern scleractinian corals by ca. 250my, and that this particular niche was independently invaded by over 20 lineages in green algae evolution. These results highlight the potential of the multi-marker approach to assist in species discovery and, when combined with a phylogenetic framework, clarify the evolutionary origins of host-microbiota associations.},

fit than the Poisson distribution, and only 1 of the data-sets fitted the

large, with 43 of the 49 data-sets having an estimated k of less

were available (i.e. host data could be divided by either host sex, age,
where or when hosts were sampled). In 11 of these
22 subsets there was significant variation in the degree of aggregation
between host subsets of the same host–parasite
system. A common k estimate was always larger than that obtained
with all the host data considered together. These
results indicate that lumping host data can hide important variations in
aggregation between hosts and can exaggerate the
true degree of aggregation. Wherever possible common k estimates
should be used to estimate the degree of aggregation.
In addition, significant differences in the degree of aggregation between
subgroups of host data, were generally associated
with significant differences in both mean parasite burdens and the prevalence
of infection.},

The most promising bacterial primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic distribution of the 16S rDNA amplicons with 16S rDNA fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes.

First, we demonstrate that COI profiles, derived from the low-density sampling of higher taxonomic categories, ordinarily assign newly analysed taxa to the appropriate phylum or order. Second, we demonstrate that species-level assignments can be obtained by creating comprehensive COI profiles. A model COI profile, based upon the analysis of a single individual from each of 200 closely allied species of lepidopterans, was 100\% successful in correctly identifying subsequent specimens. When fully developed, a COI identification system will provide a reliable, cost-effective and accessible solution to the current problem of species identification.

However, an underlying assumption is that the primers used in these studies are universal for the prokaryotic or eukaryotic groups of interest. Full primer universality is difficult or impossible to achieve and studies using different primer sets make biodiversity comparisons problematic. The aim of this study was to design and optimize universal eukaryotic primers that could be used as a standard in future biodiversity studies. Using the alignment of all eukaryotic sequences from the publicly available SILVA database, we generated a full characterization of variable versus conserved regions in the 18S rRNA gene. All variable regions within this gene were analyzed and our results suggested that the V2, V4 and V9 regions were best suited for biodiversity assessments. Previously published universal eukaryotic primers as well as a number of self-designed primers were mapped to the alignment. Primer selection will depend on sequencing technology used, and this study focused on the 454 pyrosequencing GS FLX Titanium platform. The results generated a primer pair yielding theoretical matches to 80\% of the eukaryotic and 0\% of the prokaryotic sequences in the SILVA database. An empirical test of marine sediments using the AmpliconNoise pipeline for analysis of the high throughput sequencing data yielded amplification of sequences for 71\% of all eukaryotic phyla with no isolation of prokaryotic sequences. To our knowledge this is the first characterization of the complete 18S rRNA gene using all eukaryotes present in the SILVA database, providing a robust test for universal eukaryotic primers. Since both in silico and empirical tests using high throughput sequencing retained high inclusion of eukaryotic phyla and exclusion of prokaryotes, we conclude that these primers are well suited for assessing eukaryote diversity, and can be used as a standard in biodiversity studies.},

Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) provides such tools by way of an open, community-driven infrastructure designed to lower the barrier for researchers to perform ecological systems analysis and modeling. GloBI provides a tool that (a) ingests, normalizes, and aggregates datasets, (b) integrates interoperable data with accepted ontologies (e.g., OBO Relations Ontology, Uberon, and Environment Ontology), vocabularies (e.g., Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard), and taxonomies (e.g., Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Center for Biotechnology Information Taxonomy Database), (c) makes data accessible through an application programming interface (API) and various data archives (Darwin Core, Turtle, and Neo4j), and (d) houses a data collection of about 700,000 species interactions across about 50,000 taxa, covering over 1100 references from 19 data sources. GloBI has taken an open-source and open-data approach in order to make integrated species-interaction data maximally accessible and to encourage users to provide feedback, contribute data, and improve data access methods. The GloBI collection of datasets is currently used in the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions (GoMexSI).},

	abstract = {DNA barcoding and metabarcoding methods have been invaluable in the study of interactions between host organisms and their symbiotic communities. Barcodes can help identify individual symbionts that are difficult to distinguish using morphological characters, and provide a way to classify undescribed species. Entire symbiont communities can be characterized rapidly using barcoding and especially metabarcoding methods, which is often crucial for isolating ecological signal from the substantial variation among individual hosts. Furthermore, barcodes allow the evolutionary histories of symbionts and their hosts to be assessed simultaneously and in reference to one another. Here, we describe three projects illustrating the utility of barcodes for studying symbiotic interactions: first, we consider communities of arthropods found in the ant-occupied domatia of the East African ant-plant Vachellia ( Acacia ) drepanolobium ; second, we examine communities of arthropod and protozoan inquilines in three species of Nepenthes pitcher plant in South East Asia; third, we investigate communities of gut bacteria of South American ants in the genus Cephalotes . Advances in sequencing and computation, and greater database connectivity, will continue to expand the utility of barcoding methods for the study of species interactions, especially if barcoding can be approached flexibly by making use of alternative genetic loci, metagenomes and whole-genome data.

The discovery of specific restriction endonucleases (Smith and Wilcox 1970) made possible the isolation of discrete molecular fragments of naturally occurring DNA for the first time. This capability was crucial to the development of molecular cloning (Cohen et al. 1973); and the combination of molecular cloning and endonuclease restriction allowed the synthesis and isolation of any naturally occurring DNA sequence that could be cloned into a useful vector and, on the basis of flanking restriction sites, excised from it. The availability of a large variety of restriction enzymes (Roberts 1985) has significantly extended the utility of these methods.
The de novo organic synthesis of oligonucleotides and the development of methods for their assembly into long double-stranded DNA molecules (Davies and Gassen 1983) have removed, at least theoretically, the minor limitations imposed by the availability of natural sequences with fortuitously unique flanking restriction sites. However, de novo synthesis, even with automated...},

	abstract = {The unprecedented amount of data resulting from next-generation sequencing has opened a new era in phylogenetic estimation. Although large datasets should, in theory, increase phylogenetic resolution, massive, multilocus datasets have uncovered a great deal of phylogenetic incongruence among different genomic regions, due both to stochastic error and to the action of different evolutionary process such as incomplete lineage sorting, gene duplication and loss and horizontal gene transfer. This incongruence violates one of the fundamental assumptions of the DNA barcoding approach, which assumes that gene history and species history are identical. In this review, we explain some of the most important challenges we will have to face to reconstruct the history of species, and the advantages and disadvantages of different strategies for the phylogenetic analysis of multilocus data. In particular, we describe the evolutionary events that can generate species tree—gene tree discordance, compare the most popular methods for species tree reconstruction, highlight the challenges we need to face when using them and discuss their potential utility in barcoding. Current barcoding methods sacrifice a great amount of statistical power by only considering one locus, and a transition to multilocus barcodes would not only improve current barcoding methods, but also facilitate an eventual transition to species-tree-based barcoding strategies, which could better accommodate scenarios where the barcode gap is too small or inexistent.

	abstract = {Background
Likelihood-based phylogenetic inference is generally considered to be the most reliable classification method for unknown sequences. However, traditional likelihood-based phylogenetic methods cannot be applied to large volumes of short reads from next-generation sequencing due to computational complexity issues and lack of phylogenetic signal. "Phylogenetic placement," where a reference tree is fixed and the unknown query sequences are placed onto the tree via a reference alignment, is a way to bring the inferential power offered by likelihood-based approaches to large data sets.

Results
This paper introduces pplacer, a software package for phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization. The algorithm can place twenty thousand short reads on a reference tree of one thousand taxa per hour per processor, has essentially linear time and memory complexity in the number of reference taxa, and is easy to run in parallel. Pplacer features calculation of the posterior probability of a placement on an edge, which is a statistically rigorous way of quantifying uncertainty on an edge-by-edge basis. It also can inform the user of the positional uncertainty for query sequences by calculating expected distance between placement locations, which is crucial in the estimation of uncertainty with a well-sampled reference tree. The software provides visualizations using branch thickness and color to represent number of placements and their uncertainty. A simulation study using reads generated from 631 COG alignments shows a high level of accuracy for phylogenetic placement over a wide range of alignment diversity, and the power of edge uncertainty estimates to measure placement confidence.

Conclusions
Pplacer enables efficient phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization, making likelihood-based phylogenetics methodology practical for large collections of reads; it is freely available as source code, binaries, and a web service.},

However, current reference based profiling methods only report the presence and abundance of single reference genomes that are available in databases. Since only a small fraction of environmental genomes is represented in genomic databases, these approaches entail the risk of false identifications and often suggest a higher precision than justified by the data. Therefore, we developed MicrobeGPS, a novel metagenomic profiling approach that overcomes these limitations. MicrobeGPS is the first method that identifies microbiota in the sample and estimates their genomic distances to known reference genomes. With this strategy, MicrobeGPS identifies organisms down to the strain level and highlights possibly inaccurate identifications when the correct reference genome is missing. We demonstrate on three metagenomic datasets with different origin that our approach successfully avoids misleading interpretation of results and additionally provides more accurate results than current profiling methods. Our results indicate that MicrobeGPS can enable reference based taxonomic profiling of complex and less characterized microbial communities. MicrobeGPS is open source and available from  https://sourceforge.net/projects/microbegps/  as source code and binary distribution for Windows and Linux operating systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metagenetic analyses, which amplify and sequence target marker DNA regions from environmental samples, are increasingly employed to assess the biodiversity of communities of small organisms. Using this approach, our understanding of microbial diversity has expanded greatly. In contrast, only a few studies using this approach to characterize metazoan diversity have been reported, despite the fact that many metazoan species are small and difficult to identify or are undescribed. One of the reasons for this discrepancy is the availability of universal primers for the target taxa. In microbial studies, analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA is standard. In contrast, the best gene for metazoan metagenetics is less clear. In the present study, we have designed primers that amplify the nuclear 18S and 28S ribosomal DNA sequences of most metazoan species with the goal of providing effective approaches for metagenetic analyses of metazoan diversity in environmental samples, with a particular emphasis on marine biodiversity.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Conserved regions suitable for designing PCR primers were identified using 14,503 and 1,072 metazoan sequences of the nuclear 18S and 28S rDNA regions, respectively. The sequence similarity of both these newly designed and the previously reported primers to the target regions of these primers were compared for each phylum to determine the expected amplification efficacy. The nucleotide diversity of the flanking regions of the primers was also estimated for genera or higher taxonomic groups of 11 phyla to determine the variable regions within the genes.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The identified nuclear ribosomal DNA primers (five primer pairs for 18S and eleven for 28S) and the results of the nucleotide diversity analyses provide options for primer combinations for metazoan metagenetic analyses. Additionally, advantages and disadvantages of not only the 18S and 28S ribosomal DNA, but also other marker regions as targets for metazoan metagenetic analyses, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier, a naïve Bayesian classifier, can rapidly and accurately classify bacterial 16S rRNA sequences into the new higher-order taxonomy proposed in Bergey's Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (2nd ed., release 5.0, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, 2004). It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98\%) were of high estimated confidence (≥95\%) and high accuracy (98\%). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89\% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are available online at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/.},

One approach to integration is through the annotation of multiple bodies of data using common controlled vocabularies or 'ontologies'. Unfortunately, the very success of this approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies, which itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality. We describe this OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those who might wish to become involved.},

	abstract = {Not only is the number of described species a very small proportion of the estimated extant number of taxa, but it also appears that all concepts of the extent and boundaries of 'species' fail in many cases. Using conserved molecular sequences it is possible to define and diagnose molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTU) that have a similar extent to traditional 'species'. Use of a MOTU system not only allows the rapid and effective identification of most taxa, including those not encountered before, but also allows investigation of the evolution of patterns of diversity. A MOTU approach is not without problems, particularly in the area of deciding what level of molecular difference defines a biologically relevant taxon, but has many benefits. Molecular data are extremely well suited to re-analysis and meta-analysis, and data from multiple independent studies can be readily collated and investigated by using new parameters and assumptions. Previous molecular taxonomic efforts have focused narrowly. Advances in high-throughput sequencing methodologies, however, place the idea of a universal, multi-locus molecular barcoding system in the realm of the possible.},

	abstract = {Background
Anguillicolidae Yamaguti, 1935 is a family of parasitic nematode infecting fresh-water eels of the genus Anguilla, comprising five species in the genera Anguillicola and Anguillicoloides. Anguillicoloides crassus is of particular importance, as it has recently spread from its endemic range in the Eastern Pacific to Europe and North America, where it poses a significant threat to new, naïve hosts such as the economic important eel species Anguilla anguilla and Anguilla rostrata. The Anguillicolidae are therefore all potentially invasive taxa, but the relationships of the described species remain unclear. Anguillicolidae is part of Spirurina, a diverse clade made up of only animal parasites, but placement of the family within Spirurina is based on limited data.

Results
We generated an extensive DNA sequence dataset from three loci (the 5' one-third of the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA, the D2-D3 region of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal RNA and the 5' half of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene) for the five species of Anguillicolidae and used this to investigate specific and generic boundaries within the family, and the relationship of Anguillicolidae to other spirurine nematodes. Neither nuclear nor mitochondrial sequences supported monophyly of Anguillicoloides. Genetic diversity within the African species Anguillicoloides papernai was suggestive of cryptic taxa, as was the finding of distinct lineages of Anguillicoloides novaezelandiae in New Zealand and Tasmania. Phylogenetic analysis of the Spirurina grouped the Anguillicolidae together with members of the Gnathostomatidae and Seuratidae.

Conclusions
The Anguillicolidae is part of a complex radiation of parasitic nematodes of vertebrates with wide host diversity (chondrichthyes, teleosts, squamates and mammals), most closely related to other marine vertebrate parasites that also have complex life cycles. Molecular analyses do not support the recent division of Anguillicolidae into two genera. The described species may hide cryptic taxa, identified here by DNA taxonomy, and this DNA barcoding approach may assist in tracking species invasions. The propensity for host switching, and thus the potential for invasive behaviour, is found in A. crassus, A. novaezelandiae and A. papernai, and thus may be common to the group.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of molecular data to build phylogenetic trees and sophisticated computer-aided techniques to analyze them have led to a revolution in the study of cospeciation. Tangled Trees provides an up-to-date review and synthesis of current knowledge about phylogeny, cospeciation, and coevolution. The opening chapters present various methodological and theoretical approaches, ranging from the well-known parsimony approach to "jungles" and Bayesian statistical models. Then a series of empirical chapters discusses detailed studies of cospeciation involving vertebrate hosts and their parasites, including nematodes, viruses, and lice. Tangled Trees will be welcomed by researchers in a wide variety of fields, from parasitology and ecology to systematics and evolutionary biology.Contributors:Sarah Al-Tamimi, Michael A.

	abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random “shotgun” approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

	abstract = {Many microbes associate with higher eukaryotes and impact their vitality. To engineer microbiomes for host benefit, we must understand the rules of community assembly and maintenance that, in large part, demand an understanding of the direct interactions among community members. Toward this end, we have developed a Poisson-multivariate normal hierarchical model to learn direct interactions from the count-based output of standard metagenomics sequencing experiments. Our model controls for confounding predictors at the Poisson layer and captures direct taxon–taxon interactions at the multivariate normal layer using an ℓ1 penalized precision matrix. We show in a synthetic experiment that our method handily outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as SparCC and the graphical lasso (glasso). In a real in planta perturbation experiment of a nine-member bacterial community, we show our model, but not SparCC or glasso, correctly resolves a direct interaction structure among three community members that associates with Arabidopsis thaliana roots. We conclude that our method provides a structured, accurate, and distributionally reasonable way of modeling correlated count-based random variables and capturing direct interactions among them.},
