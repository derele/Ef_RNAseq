  Cluster 1, BP, Ef.
  Overrepresented GO biological process terms among parasite genes which are 
  highly abundant on day 7 p.i.. Compared to cluster 2, which also have a high
  abundance on day 7, these genes cluster more closely with genes in cluster 4, 
  which are highly expressed in oocysts.\\

\section{Results for mouse}
  Cluster 1, BP, Mm
  Overrepresented GO biological process terms among mouse genes which have low abundance pre infection and 
  become more abundant in most day 3 and 5 samples from immunecompetent mice, but less in immune deficient Rag1-/- mice. 
  The upregulation trend is most clear in three first infection day 5 samples, which also form a separate
  sample cluster. On day 7, most of these genes are not differentially abundant, or below average, i.e., they
  seem to peak on day 5 p.i..\\

  Cluster 3, BP, Mm.
  Overrepresented GO biological process terms among mouse genes which are upregulated pre infection and
  downregulated on day 7 p.i., except in one NMRI second infection sample, possibly indicating no or
  poor infection in this sample. As in cluster 2, these mRNAs are most highly abundant before infection and
  become less abundant over the course of infection.\\

  There is overall no clear difference between pre infection and days 3 or 5 among these genesi. A slight

%\section{Answers to Definitions}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\begin{item}
%  The \emph{atomic weight of an element} is the relative weight of
%  one of its atoms compared to C-12 with a weight of
%  12.0000000$\ldots$, hydrogen with a weight of 1.008, to oxygen with
%  a weight of 16.00. Atomic weight is also the average weight of all
%  the atoms of that element as they occur in nature.
%\end{item}
%\begin{item}
%  The \emph{units of atomic weight} are two-fold, with an identical
%  numerical value. They are g/mole of atoms (or just g/mol) or
%  amu/atom.
%\end{item}
%\begin{item}
%  \emph{Percentage discrepancy} between an accepted (literature)
%  value and an experimental value is
%\begin{equation*}
%\frac{\mathrm{experimental\;result} - \mathrm{accepted\;result}}{\mathrm{accepted\;result}}
%\end{equation*}
